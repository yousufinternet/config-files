Alpha processing is used to improve the vertical resolution of neutron porosity and other dual-detector nuclear logs. The detector near the source has better precision than the far detector in the sense that it responds more precisely to vertical changes. However, the near detector is less accurate because it is more affected by the borehole environment. Alpha processing mathematically superimposes the rapid changes of the near detector on the slowly changing but accurate far detector to produce an accurate log with high vertical resolution.\nThe technique is also used to improve results from the carbon-oxygen log and other pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurements. Two methods are used to determine the carbon/oxygen ratio. The windows method counts the number of gamma rays within energy windows placed at the main peaks for carbon and oxygen. This method has good statistical precision but poor accuracy, as gamma rays from other elements contaminate these windows. The other method, spectral stripping, compares the total spectrum against standards for many elements, inverting the spectrum to obtain the yield for each element. This method is more accurate but has less statistical precision. Averaging over a number of measurements, alpha processing adjusts the windows result with the more accurate spectral stripping in order to obtain a precise and accurate result.\n\nSee:\ncompensated neutron log, pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurement, response matched, vertical response",

Successful AVO analysis requires special processing of seismic data and seismic modeling to determine rock properties with a known fluid content. With that knowledge, it is possible to model other types of fluid content. A gas-filled sandstone might show increasing amplitude with offset, whereas a coal might show decreasing amplitude with offset. A limitation of AVO analysis using only P-energy is its failure to yield a unique solution, so AVO results are prone to misinterpretation.

The aniline point (AP) correlates roughly with the amount and type of aromatic hydrocarbons in an oil sample. A low AP is indicative of higher aromatics, while a high AP is indicative of lower aromatics content. Diesel oil with AP below 120 degF [49 degC] is probably risky to use in oil-based mud.

Annular gas flows occur when there is insufficient hydrostatic pressure to restrain the gas. They can occur in uncemented intervals and even in cemented sections if the cement bond is poor. After cementing, as the cement begins to harden, a gel-like structure forms that effectively supports the solid material in the cement slurry. However, during this initial gelling period, the cement has no appreciable strength. Hence, with the solid (weighting) material now supported by the gel structure, the effective density of the slurry that the reservoir experiences falls rather suddenly to the density of the mix water of the cement, which is usually freshwater, whose density is 8.34 lbm/galUS, or a gradient of 0.434 psi/ft of vertical column height.

The annulus forms during invasion and is caused by the different mobilities of oil and water. It only occurs in the presence of both, but is unstable and will dissipate vertically or horizontally with time. The annulus has approximately the same water saturation as the flushed zone but contains formation water. When the formation water is much more saline than the mud filtrate, the annulus forms a conductive ring around the borehole.\nThis conductivity will cause an induction log to read too low a resistivity, by an amount that depends on its depth of investigation and the radius of the annulus. (Laterologs are little affected since they respond to resistivity, not conductivity.) Often a medium log will be more affected than a deep log so that an annulus can be detected by out-of-order curves (medium curves reading less than either shallow or deep).

Variation in seismic reflection amplitude with change in distance between shotpoint and receiver that indicates differences in lithology and fluid content in rocks above and below the reflector. AVO analysis is a technique by which geophysicists attempt to determine thickness, porosity, density, velocity, lithology and fluid content of rocks. Successful AVO analysis requires special processing of seismic data and seismic modeling to determine rock properties with a known fluid content. With that knowledge, it is possible to model other types of fluid content. A gas-filled sandstone might show increasing amplitude with offset, whereas a coal might show decreasing amplitude with offset. A limitation of AVO analysis using only P-energy is its failure to yield a unique solution, so AVO results are prone to misinterpretation. One common misinterpretation is the failure to distinguish a gas-filled reservoir from a reservoir having only partial gas saturation (\"fizz water\"). However, AVO analysis using source-generated or mode-converted shear wave energy allows differentiation of degrees of gas saturation.

Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv.\nIn formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock. Although quicker and simpler to perform, they are less representative of electrical properties in situ.

Commercial bentonite ores vary widely in amount and quality of the swelling clay, sodium montmorillonite. Ores of lower quality, those with more calcium-type montmorillonite, are treated during grinding by adding one or more of the following: sodium carbonate, long-chain synthetic polymers, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), starch, or polyphosphates. These help make the final product meet quality specifications. Unfortunately, the additives may not remain effective in \"the real mud world\" when in use at the rig due to hardness ions in the water, high temperature, bacterial attack, mechanical shear-degradation, and other factors that can render these additives ineffective.\n\nSee:\ncation exchange capacity, clay extender, conventional mud, hectorite, low-solids mud, low-yield clay, native clay, organophilic clay, peptized clay, phosphate salt, prehydrated bentonite, seawater mud, smectite, smectite clay, sulfonated polystyrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride copolymer, water, oil, and solids test",

  "BGG": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn average or baseline measure of gas entrained in circulating mud. This baseline trend pertains to gas that is liberated downhole while drilling through a uniform lithologic interval at a constant rate of penetration. The gas is typically obtained from a suction line above the gas trap located immediately upstream of the shale shaker screens, where the gas evolves out of the mud.\nOil-based mud systems tend to produce higher background gas values than do water-based muds.\nDeviations from the background gas trend likely indicate changes in porosity or permeability, or changes in drilling conditions; any of which merits further investigation.

Similarly, a high-temperature well may be cooled down in an attempt to allow logging tools to function. The BHCT is also important in the design of operations to cement casing because the setting time for cement is temperature-dependent.

The BHP gradient should exceed the formation pressure gradient to avoid an influx of formation fluid into the wellbore.\nOn the other hand, if BHP (including the added fluid friction pressure of a flowing fluid) is too high, a weak formation may fracture and cause a loss of wellbore fluids. The loss of fluid to one formation may be followed by the influx of fluid from another formation.\n\nAlternate Form:\nbottomhole pressure",

The formation cools during drilling and most of the cooling dissipates after about 24 hours of static conditions, although it is theoretically impossible for the temperature to return to undisturbed conditions. This temperature is measured under static conditions after sufficient time has elapsed to negate any effects from circulating fluids. Tables, charts, and computer routines are used to predict BHST as functions of depth, geographic area, and various time functions.

  "BHT": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe temperature in the borehole at total depth at the time it is measured. In log interpretation, the bottom hole temperature (BHT) is taken as the maximum recorded temperature during a logging run, or preferably the last of series of runs during the same operation.

These charges typically are used in sand control completions, in which efficient placement of the gravel pack treatment within the perforation tunnel is crucial. Altering the explosive charge design and materials creates a larger diameter entrance hole on the perforation while reducing the depth of penetration. However, gravel-pack treatments generally are applied in high-permeability formations where perforation tunnel length is less important. Wells that are to be hydraulically fractured also can benefit from larger perforations since the effective penetration is significantly increased by a high-conductivity fracture.",

A small electric current flows from one piece of metal to the other, accelerating the corrosion rate of the more reactive of the two metals.\nBimetallic corrosion is sometimes found when new pipe is added to old pipelines.

  "bimetallism": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe electromagnetic force created by two different metals in contact with each other. If two such metals are in contact in a logging tool and also communicate along a conductive borehole, then a potential drop is generated in the borehole. This potential drop will appear on the spontaneous potential (SP) log, where it can be confused with the electrochemical potential. Since the magnitude of the drop depends on the formation resistivity, the effect of bimetallism is often seen as a resistivity log superimposed on the normal SP. Under usual circumstances, the effect of bimetallism on the SP is small, and care is taken to avoid it.\n\nSee:\nshale baseline, static spontaneous potential",
  "Bingham plastic model": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA two-parameter rheological model widely used in the drilling fluids industry to describe flow characteristics of many types of muds. It can be described mathematically as follows:\nτ = YP + PV(γ), where\nτ = shear stress\nγ = shear rate\nYP = yield point\nPV = plastic viscosity.\n\nFluids obeying this model are called Bingham plastic fluids and exhibit a linear shear-stress, shear-rate behavior after an initial shear stress threshold has been reached. Plastic viscosity (PV) is the slope of the line and yield point (YP) is the threshold stress. PV should be as low as possible for fast drilling and is best achieved by minimizing colloidal solids. YP must be high enough to carry cuttings out of the hole, but not so large as to create excessive pump pressure when starting mud flow. YP is adjusted by judicious choices of mud treatments.

  "Biot theory": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA theory developed by M.A. Biot for acoustic propagation in a porous and elastic medium. Compressional and shear velocities can be calculated by standard elastic theory from the composite density, shear, and bulk modulus of the total rock. The problem is how to determine these from the properties of the constituent parts. Biot showed that the composite properties could be determined from the porosity and the elastic properties (density and moduli) of the fluid, the solid material, and the empty rock skeleton, or framework. To account for different frequencies of propagation, it is also necessary to know the frequency, the permeability of the rock, the viscosity of the fluid, and a coefficient for the inertial drag between skeleton and fluid.\n\nUnlike the Gassmann model, the Biot theory takes into account frequency variations and allows for relative motion between fluid and rock framework. As a result, it predicts some of the observed changes in velocity with frequency as well as the critical frequency below which the Gassmann model is valid. It also predicts the existence of a so-called slow wave in addition to the shear wave and the compressional, or fast wave. The slow wave arises when the fluid and the skeleton move 180° out-of-phase with each other. Its velocity is related to fluid mobility, but unfortunately has been observed only in the laboratory, not on logs. At logging frequencies, it degenerates into a diffusion phenomenon rather than a wave, and is apparently too highly attenuated to be observed in real rocks. However, in permeable formations, the Stoneley wave couples into the slow wave, causing the attenuation and dispersion that allow the measurement of Stoneley permeability.\nThe full Biot theory is used mainly to analyze laboratory data. For practical log interpretation, it is more common to use the simpler Gassmann model.\n\nReference:\n\nBiot MA: Theory of Propagation of Elastic Waves in a Fluid-Saturated Porous Solid: I Low Frequency Range, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 28, (1956): 168-178.\n\nBiot MA: Theory of Propagation of Elastic Waves in a Fluid-Saturated Porous Solid: II Higher Frequency Range, Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 28, (1956): 179-191.\n\n\nSee:\nsonic log",

Birefringence occurs in optical mineralogy (see petrography) when plane-polarized light passes through an anisotropic mineral and emerges as two rays traveling at different speeds, the difference between which is characteristic of a mineral.\nIn seismology, incident S-waves can exhibit birefringence as they split into a quasi-shear and a pure-shear wave. Although birefringence was first described by Danish physician Erasmus Bartholin (1625 to 1698) in crystals in 1669, the phenomenon was not fully understood until French physicist Etienne-Louis Malus (1775 to 1812) described polarized light in 1808.\n\nSynonyms:\ndouble refraction\n\nSee:\nanisotropy, S-wave, seismology, velocity",
  "bit": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe tool used to crush or cut rock. Everything on a drilling rig directly or indirectly assists the bit in crushing or cutting the rock. The bit is on the bottom of the drillstring and must be changed when it becomes excessively dull or stops making progress. Most bits work by scraping or crushing the rock, or both, usually as part of a rotational motion.

  "bit nozzle": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe part of the bit that includes a hole or opening for drilling fluid to exit. The hole is usually small (around 0.25-in diameter) and the pressure of the fluid inside the bit is usually high, leading to a high exit velocity through the nozzles that creates a high-velocity jet below the nozzles.

  "bit resistivity": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe resistivity measured at the drill bit by a measurements-while-drilling (MWD) tool. The bit resistivity measurement responds to resistivity changes as the bit penetrates the formation, or when the time after bit is zero. It is thus an early indication of formation change. The measurement is similar to a wireline electrode device except that toroids are used instead of electrodes. A transmitter toroid induces a low-frequency current in the drillstring, which flows out of the bit and returns farther up the string. The magnitude of the current depends on the resistivity near the bit, and is measured by another toroid. The vertical resolution and depth of investigation depend on the distances between the toroids and the bit, which, in turn, depend on the type of bottomhole assembly (BHA) used. The depth of investigation is sufficient that the effect of the borehole is normally small. The measurement is unfocused and usually not borehole-corrected.

These qualities help retain the core's native properties and can retain some (or all) of the reservoir's fluids [water, oil and gas (gas only if kept under pressure)]. Bland water-based fluid is formulated to make the filtrate resemble the connate water in the reservoir. Keeping ionic composition and especially the pH matched to the reservoir water is most important. Thus, strong alkaline agents and clay deflocculants are avoided when designing bland coring fluids. Bland oil-based fluids should contain no water phase, and the base oil should resemble the reservoir oil. (Reservoir crude is used in some cases.) Amine, amide, phosphonated and sulfonated emulsifiers, and the powerful oil-wetting agents are also avoided. Fatty acid soaps are chosen to emulsify the trace of water that is likely to be encountered. Additives that minimize dynamic filtration rate must be chosen. Setting mud density and bit hydraulics to give equivalent circulating density close to the reservoir pressure helps avoid filtrate invasion into the core.

This allows interpretable test results.\n\nSee:\ndrawdown test",

It is usually denoted NC in the oil field and Ca in chemical engineering. For a flowing liquid, if NC >>1, then viscous forces dominate over interfacial forces; however if NC <<1, then viscous forces are negligible compared with interfacial forces. Capillary numbers are usually large for high-speed flows and low for low-speed flows; thus, typically for flow through pores in the reservoir NC is ~10−6, and for flow in production tubulars NC is ~1.\nCapillary number equation:\nNC = Ca = (μU) / σ\nwhere\n\nNC = Ca = capillary number\nμ = fluid viscosity\nU = fluid velocity\nσ = surface or interfacial tension.\n\n\nSee:\ninterfacial tension",

The lag period can be measured as a function of time or pump strokes. Acetylene is commonly used as a tracer gas for this purpose. This gas is generated by calcium carbide, a man-made product that reacts with water.\nUsually, a small paper packet containing calcium carbide is inserted into the drillstring when the kelly is unscrewed from the pipe to make a connection, and the time is noted, along with the pump-stroke count on the mud pump. Once the connection is made and drilling resumes, the packet is pumped downhole with the drilling fluid. Along the way, the drilling fluid breaks down the paper and reacts with the calcium carbide. The resulting acetylene gas circulates with the drilling fluid until it reaches the surface, where it is detected at the gas trap, causing a rapid increase or spike in gas readings. The time and pump-stroke count are again noted, and the cuttings sample lag interval is calculated.\n\nSee:\ncycle time, lag gas, lag time",

At low pH, carbon dioxide [CO2] dominates. As pH rises from acidic toward neutral, HCO3– ions dominate. As pH rises above neutral, CO3–2 ions dominate. If no component is lost from the system (such as CO2 gas evolving), changing pH up and down continually reverses the relative proportion of the carbonate species. Carbonates play several important roles in water mud chemistry.\n\nOne role is the corrosion of metals by acidic CO2.\nA second is the formation of calcium carbonate [CaCO3] scale on surfaces by carbonate and calcium ion reactions.\nAnother role is in the chemistry of deflocculated mud, where bicarbonate ions prevent attachment of deflocculants such as lignosulfonate, onto clay edge charges.\n\n\nSee:\nalkalinity, buffered mud, calcium hydroxide, calcium sulfate, carbonate test, Garrett Gas Train, hydrolysis, lignite, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate",

To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO–) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water solubility and negativity of the polymer, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a mud additive.

A continuous 360° annular space around casing allows cement to completely seal the casing to the borehole wall. There are two distinct classes of centralizers. The older and more common is a simple, low-cost bow-spring design. Since the bow springs are slightly larger than the wellbore, they can provide complete centralization in vertical or slightly deviated wells. However, they do not support the weight of the casing very well in deviated wellbores. The second type is a rigid blade design. This type is rugged and works well even in deviated wellbores, but since the centralizers are smaller than the wellbore, they will not provide as good centralization as bow-spring type centralizers in vertical wells.

  "casing grade": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA system of identifying and categorizing the strength of casing materials. Since most oilfield casing is of approximately the same chemistry (typically steel) and differs only in the heat treatment applied, the grading system provides for standardized strengths of casing to be manufactured and used in wellbores. The first part of the nomenclature, a letter, refers to the tensile strength. The second part of the designation, a number, refers to the minimum yield strength of the metal (after heat treatment) at 1, 000 psi [6895 KPa]. For example, the casing grade J-55 has minimum yield strength of 55, 000 psi [379, 211 KPa]. The casing grade P-110 designates a higher strength pipe with minimum yield strength of 110, 000 psi [758, 422 KPa]. The appropriate casing grade for any application typically is based on pressure and corrosion requirements. Since the well designer is concerned about the pipe yielding under various loading conditions, the casing grade is the number that is used in most calculations. High-strength casing materials are more expensive, so a casing string may incorporate two or more casing grades to optimize costs while maintaining adequate mechanical performance over the length of the string. It is also important to note that, in general, the higher the yield strength, the more susceptible the casing is to sulfide stress cracking (H2S-induced cracking). Therefore, if H2S is anticipated, the well designer may not be able to use tubulars with strength as high as he or she would like.\n\nSee:\ncasing string, float shoe, hydrogen sulfide",

Cathodic protection does not eliminate corrosion; it transfers corrosion from the structure under protection to a known location where artificial anodes (plates or metal bars) are placed and could be replaced easily. Cathodic protection is used for floating vessels, platforms, storage tanks, and pipelines.\nThe cathodic protection principle is based on the electrochemical nature of the corrosion phenomena; the anodic area corrodes (current is discharged) and the cathodic area does not corrode (current is received). Cathodic protection overrides the naturally occurring anodic areas inside a structure, thus turning the structure under protection completely cathodic, which means it receives current from the surrounding electrolyte (for example, soils, water) and does not corrode.

Clays are aluminosilicates in which some of the aluminum and silicon ions have been replaced by elements with different valence, or charge. For example, aluminum (Al+++) may be replaced by iron (Fe++) or magnesium (Mg++), leading to a net negative charge. This charge attracts cations when the clay is immersed in an electrolyte such as salty water and causes an electrical double layer. The cation-exchange capacity (CEC) is often expressed in terms of its contribution per unit pore volume, Qv.\nIn formation evaluation, it is the contribution of cation-exchange sites to the formation electrical properties that is important. Various techniques are used to measure CEC in the laboratory, such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity, and membrane potential. Wet chemistry methods, such as conductometric titration, usually involve destruction or alteration of the rock.

In smooth boreholes of constant diameter, the effect of the borehole is well understood and can be corrected for. However, a sharp increase in diameter over a small depth interval can induce signals on one coil in the array and not in others. This signal is not handled by the normal borehole correction and may result in a spike on the log.

  "CBM": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nAbbreviation for coalbed methane. Natural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases.\nProduction of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates.\nCoal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines.\nCoal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited. In these reservoirs, the adsorbed gas is held in place by free gas in the cleats. Consequently, gas production consists of both free gas from the cleat system and desorbed gas from the matrix.\n\nSynonyms:\ncoal seam gas, CSG\n\nAlternate Form:\ncoalbed methane, coalbed methane, coalbed methane\n\nSee:\nunconventional resource",

To make CMC, OH groups on the glucose rings of cellulose are ether-linked to carboxymethyl (-OCH2-COO-) groups. (Note the negative charge.) Each glucose ring has three OH groups capable of reaction, degree-of-substitution = 3. Degree of substitution determines water solubility and negativity of the polymer, which influences a CMC's effectiveness as a mud additive. Drilling grade CMCs used in muds typically have degree-of-substitution around 0.80 to 0.96. Carboxymethylcellulose is commonly supplied either as low-viscosity (\"CMC-Lo Vis\") or high-viscosity (\"CMC-Hi Vis\") grades, both of which have API specifications.

Generally speaking, oilfield cement is thinner and exhibits far less strength than cement or concrete used for construction due to the requirement that it be highly pumpable in relatively narrow annulus over long distances. Various additives are used to control density, setting time, strength and flow properties. Additionally, special additives are often used to reduce the occurrence of annular gas flow. The cement slurry, commonly formed by mixing portland cement, water and assorted dry and liquid additives, is pumped into place and allowed to solidify (typically for 12 to 24 hours) before additional drilling activity can resume. The cement usually must reach a strength of 5, 000 psi [34, 474 KPa] before drilling or perforating.

To date, economic liberation of hydrocarbon gases from hydrates has not occurred, but hydrates contain quantities of hydrocarbons that could be of great economic significance. Hydrates can affect seismic data by creating a reflection or multiple.\n\nSynonyms:\ngas hydrate\n\nSee:\nmethane hydrate\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Production Testing]\n\nCompounds or complex ions that are formed by the union of water with other substances. Hydrates can form in pipelines and in gas gathering, compression and transmission facilities at reduced temperatures and high pressures. Once hydrates are formed, they can plug the pipelines and significantly affect production operations.\n\nSynonyms:\nhydrate\n\n\n\n\n3. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA crystalline solid consisting of water with gas molecules in an ice-like cage structure. The general term for this type of solid is clathrate. Water molecules form a lattice structure into which many types of gas molecules can fit. Most gases, except hydrogen and helium, can form hydrates. C1 to nC5 hydrocarbons, H2S and CO2 readily form hydrates at low temperature and high pressure. Heavier hydrocarbons may also enter the structure but do not form hydrates by themselves. Gas-cut muds can form hydrates in deepwater drilling operations, plugging BOP lines, risers and subsea wellheads, causing a well-control risk. Gas hydrates are thermodynamically suppressed by adding antifreeze materials such as salts or glycols. A common practice is to use 20 to 23 wt% NaCl. Nucleation and growth of hydrates can be dynamically inhibited by certain polymers or surfactants. Gas hydrates are found in nature, on the bottom of cold seas and in arctic permafrost regions. Drilling into these can be hazardous, but they offer another source of hydrocarbons for future exploitation.\n\n\nReference: Ebeltoft H, Yousif M and Soergaard E: \"Hydrate Control During Deep-water Drilling: Overview and New Drilling Fluids Formulations, \" paper SPE 38567, presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, San Antonio, Texas, USA, October 5-8, 1997.\n\nSynonyms:\ngas hydrate",

[Geology]\n\nFine-grained sediments less than 0.0039 mm in size.\n\nSee:\nargillaceous, colloid, deflocculant, dirty, eolian, hectorite, matrix, polar compound, quebracho, SAPP, sediment, shale, silicate anion, Udden-Wentworth scale\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Geology]\n\nA group of rock-forming, hydrous aluminum silicate minerals that are platy in structure and can form by the alteration of silicate minerals like feldspar and amphibole. Common examples include chlorite, illite, kaolinite, montmorillonite and smectite. Some clays, such as montmorillonite, have the tendency to swell when exposed to water, creating a potential drilling hazard when clay-bearing rock formations are exposed to water-base fluids during drilling, possibly reducing the permeability of a good reservoir rock. Some clays are used in drilling fluids to form an impermeable mudcake to isolate a formation from the invasion of drilling fluid.\n\nThe structural difference among clays (smectite, kaolinite, chlorite, illite) determines the surface area exposed to reservoir fluids or stimulating fluids. Generally, higher surface area indicates higher reactivity. However, not all the clay present in a rock is reactive. Clays can be found in pore spaces, as part of the matrix or as grain-cementing material. Authigenic clays, which grow in the pores from minerals in the connate water, can be pore-filling or pore-lining. These clays have considerable surface area exposed in the pore and can be reactive, while detrital clays that are part of the matrix are usually less reactive. Additionally, clays as cementing, or grain-binding, materials may react with water or acid to disaggregate the formation if they are not protected by quartz overgrowths.\n\nThe most common clays that create clay problems are kaolinite, smectite, illite and chlorite. These minerals can be treated using hydrofluoric acid [HF].\n\nSee:\nargillaceous, bentonite, connate water, dirty, effective porosity, eolian, glauconite, limestone, mica, sedimentary, stimulation fluid, stylolite\n\n\n\n\n3. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA large family of complex minerals containing the elements magnesium, aluminum, silicon and oxygen (magnesium, aluminum silicates) combined in a sheet-like structure. Clays are mined from surface pits as relatively pure deposits and used for bricks, pottery, foundry molds and in drilling fluids among other uses. Clays, as claystones, shales and intermixed with sands and sandstones make up the largest percentage of minerals drilled while exploring for oil and gas. Sodium bentonite is a useful additive for increasing the density of drilling muds, but other clay types are considered contaminants to be avoided and removed. Individual clay platelets can be viewed only with an electron microscope. Crystal structures are also determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The atomic structure of the clay group of layered silicate minerals varies from two-layer to three-layer or four-layer (mixed-layer) structures. One of the structural layers is a plane of silicon dioxide tetrahedra (silicon at the center and oxygen at all four corners of the tetrahedron). The other structural layer is a plane of aluminum hydroxide octahedra (aluminum at the center and hydroxides at all six corners). The tetrahedral and octahedral layers fit one on top of the other, with oxygen atoms being shared as oxide and hydroxide groups.\n\nSee:\naggregation, anion, attapulgite, cation exchange capacity, clay-water interaction, colloidal solids, conventional mud, encapsulation, gel, hectorite, hygroscopic, inhibitive mud, ion exchange, kaolinite, montmorillonite, octahedral layer, organophilic clay, polar compound, potassium ion, quaternary amine, sepiolite, shale, silica layer, smectite clay",
  "clay extender": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA class of polymers added to a drilling-grade clay mineral during grinding, or added directly into a clay-based mud system, to enhance the clay's rheological performance. In concept, clay-extender polymers achieve the type of rheology needed for fast drilling with fewer colloidal solids and lower viscosity at high shear rate (at the bit). This is the concept of a \"low-solids, nondispersed mud\" system. Extenders are usually long-chain anionic or nonionic polymers that link clay platelets together in large networks. Anionic polymers are highly effective but can be precipitated by hardness ions. Nonionic polymers are less effective but also much less sensitive to hardness ions. Excessively long, linear polymers may break up under mechanical shearing. Either by precipitation or breakup, extender polymers can quickly become ineffective if poorly chosen and used improperly. A drilling-grade clay that has no extender is that which meets the standard for API nontreated bentonite. API bentonite and OCMA-grade API bentonite usually contain extender polymers.\n\nSee:\nacrylamide polymer, acrylamide acrylate polymer, acrylate polymer, beneficiation, clear-water drilling, hardness ion, low-solids mud, peptize, peptized clay, PHPA mud, polar compound, polymer",
  "clay stabilizer": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA chemical additive used in stimulation treatments to prevent the migration or swelling of clay particles in reaction to water-base fluid. Without adequate protection, some water-base fluids can affect the electrical charge of naturally occurring clay platelets in the formation. Modifying the charge causes the platelets to swell or migrate in the flowing fluid and, once these are dispersed, it is likely that some clay plugging of the formation matrix will occur. Clay stabilizers act to retain the clay platelets in position by controlling the charge and electrolytic characteristics of the treatment fluid.",
  "clay swelling": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA type of damage in which formation permeability is reduced because of the alteration of clay equilibrium.\n\nClay swelling occurs when water-base filtrates from drilling, completion, workover or stimulation fluids enter the formation. Clay swelling can be caused by ion exchange or changes in salinity. However, only clays that are directly contacted by the fluid moving in the rock will react; these include authigenic clays, some detrital clays on the pore boundaries and unprotected clay cement. The nature of the reaction depends on the structure of the clays and their chemical state at the moment of contact.\n\nThe most common swelling clays are smectite and smectite mixtures that create an almost impermeable barrier for fluid flow when they are located in the larger pores of a reservoir rock. In some cases, brines such as potassium chloride [KCl] are used in completion or workover operations to avoid clay swelling.\n\nSee:\ncompletion fluid, stimulation fluid, treatment fluid, workover fluid",
  "clay-bound water": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nWater within the clay lattice or near the surface within the electrical double layer. This water does not move when fluid is flowed through the rock. In the normal definition used by a log analyst, clay-bound water is not part of the effective porosity and is the difference between total porosity and effective porosity. Clay-bound water is understood to include the interlayer water, although the contribution of the latter to the electrical properties of the clay may be different from the water in the electrical double layer.\n\nIn the dual-water and the Hill-Shirley-Klein models, the volume of clay-bound water is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit volume, Qv, by expressions that depend on the salinity and temperature of the electrolyte in which the clay is immersed. Direct measurement of the clay-bound water volume in the laboratory is difficult.\n\nSee:\nbound water, dual water, free water, microporosity, small-pore water",
  "clay-water interaction": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nAn all-inclusive term to describe various progressive interactions between clay minerals and water. In the dry state, clay packets exist in face-to-face stacks like a deck of playing cards, but clay packets begin to change when exposed to water. Five descriptive terms describe the progressive interactions that can occur in a clay-water system, such as a water mud.\n\nHydration occurs as clay packets absorb water and swell.\nDispersion (or disaggregation) causes clay platelets to break apart and disperse into the water due to loss of attractive forces as water forces the platelets farther apart.\nFlocculation begins when mechanical shearing stops and platelets previously dispersed come together due to the attractive force of surface charges on the platelets.\nDeflocculation, the opposite effect, occurs by addition of chemical deflocculant to flocculated mud; the positive edge charges are covered and attraction forces are greatly reduced.\nAggregation, a result of ionic or thermal conditions, alters the hydrational layer around clay platelets, removes the deflocculant from positive edge charges and allows platelets to assume a face-to-face structure.\n\n\nSee:\nacrylamide acrylate polymer, Bingham plastic model, calcium contamination, calcium mud, capillary suction time test, closed mud system, colloid, colloidal solids, dewatering, dispersant, encapsulation, gel strength, gyp mud, hydrophilic, hygroscopic, inhibitive mud, ion exchange, kaolinite, lignosulfonate, lime mud, low-yield clay, make-up water, montmorillonite, native clay, peptized clay, peptizing agent, phosphate salt, PHPA mud, potassium mud, prehydrated bentonite, prehydration, rheology, smectite clay, sulfonated polystyrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, tannic acid, tannin, vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride copolymer, water clarification",

This system is preferred when there are few data points but the user wishes to see the dendogram to chose an appropriate number of clusters for analysis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a form of hierarchical cluster analysis.\nThe k-means system requires the user to choose the number of cluster to be determined.

  "coal seam gas": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nNatural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases.\nProduction of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates.\nCoal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat.

  "coalbed methane": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nNatural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases.\nProduction of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates.\nCoal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines.\nCoal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited.

Thus, a short spaced detector, which is very sensitive to the mudcake, can be used to correct a long-spaced detector, which is only slightly sensitive to it.\n\nIn a typical two-detector compensation scheme, the density measured by the longest spacing detector is corrected by an amount, delta rho, which is a function of the difference between long- and short-spacing densities. The correction is found to depend on the difference between formation and mudcake density multiplied by mudcake thickness. Although there are three unknowns, simple functions are reliable for moderate corrections. Experimental results are often presented in the form of a spine and ribs plot. There are other schemes using, for example, more detectors. Dual detector density logs were introduced in the mid 1960s.\n\nSee:\nazimuthal density, density measurement, photoelectric effect",

[20-cm] borehole in a limestone block, both filled with fresh water at surface temperature and pressure. The response is also determined at different porosities and in sandstones, dolomites and other borehole environments.

The model treats the rock as two components in parallel: a conductive pore network with fluid that is free to move, and the remainder of the rock, which may have conductive minerals or immobile but conductive water. The model is not concerned with the origin of this conductivity, but gives it a resistivity, Rm. The two components are in parallel as follows:\n1 / Rt = 1 / Rp + 1 / Rm\nwhere Rp is the resistance of the free-fluid pore network and can be expressed in terms of the porosity and formation water resistivity by the Archie equation.

Contract depth may be the final or total depth (TD) of the well, an intermediate point in the well or another milestone, such as running well-logging tools to the bottom of the hole. In the case of an intermediate contract depth, the work to deepen the well would likely be done on a day rate basis, or a \"time and materials\" contract.\n\nSee:\ndrilling contractor, turnkey",

  "controlled time survey": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type of radioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells.\nIn very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.\n\nSynonyms:\ntracer-loss measurement\n\nSee:\nmultiple-isotope log, production log, tracer measurement, velocity shot measurement",

The bit is usually a drag bit fitted with either PDC or natural diamond cutting structures, but the core bit is unusual in that it has a hole in its center. This allows the bit to drill around a central cylinder of rock, which is taken in through the bit and into the core barrel. The core barrel itself may be thought of as a special storage chamber for holding the rock core. The core catcher serves to grip the bottom of the core and, as tension is applied to the drillstring, the rock under the core breaks away from the undrilled formation below it. The core catcher also retains the core so that it does not fall out the bottom of the drillstring, which is open in the middle at that point.\n\nSee:\ndiamond bit, drag bit, polycrystalline diamond compact bit\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

The inner core is solid and 1220 km [750 miles] thick. The core's iron and nickel composition was inferred through studies of the Earth's gravitational field and average density.

Injected fluids may include crude oil, simulated reservoir brine, refined fluids, drilling mud filtrate, acids, foam or other chemicals used in the oil field. Depending on the purpose of the test, conditions may be either ambient temperature and low confining pressure or high temperature and pressure of a subject reservoir. Pressures and flow rates at both ends of the core are measured, and the core can also be investigated using other measurements such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) during the test.

  "CSG": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nAbbreviation for coal seam gas. Natural gas, predominantly methane [CH4], generated during coal formation and adsorbed in coal. Natural gas adsorbs to the surfaces of matrix pores within the coal and natural fractures, or cleats, as reservoir pressure increases.\nProduction of natural gas from coal requires decreasing the pore pressure below the coal’s desorption pressure so that methane will desorb from surfaces, diffuse through the coal matrix and become free gas. Because the diffusivity and permeability of the coal matrix are ultralow, coal must have an extensive cleat system to ensure adequate permeability and flow of methane to wellbores at economic production rates.\nCoal seams are typically saturated with water. Consequently, the coal must be dewatered for efficient gas production. Dewatering reduces the hydrostatic pressure and promotes gas desorption from coal. As dewatering progresses, gas production often increases at a rate governed by how quickly gas desorbs from coal, the permeability of the cleat and the relative permeability of the gas-water system in the cleat. Eventually, the rate and amount of gas desorption decreases as the coal seam is depleted of its gas, and production declines.\nCoal seams with no water (dry coal) have been discovered and commercially exploited. In these reservoirs, the adsorbed gas is held in place by free gas in the cleats. Consequently, gas production consists of both free gas from the cleat system and desorbed gas from the matrix.\n\nSynonyms:\ncoalbed methane, coalbed methane, coalbed methane, CBM\n\nAlternate Form:\ncoal seam gas, coal seam gas\n\nSee:\nunconventional resource\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

  "deflector flowmeter": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well in which the total fluid flow is diverted to pass over an impeller, or spinner. Various techniques have been used to achieve this, one of the earliest being the packer flowmeter. In a typical modern device, the diverter consists of a fabric in a metal cage that is collapsed to pass through the tubing and other restrictions. Below the tubing, the cage is opened until an inflatable ring seals against the casing wall. At this point, the up-going production fluids are forced through the diverter and over an impeller. This ensures that the total casing flow is measured, but may also create an extra pressure drop and hence a change in multiphase flow structure.\nThe diverter flowmeter is particularly suitable for low flow rates in vertical or moderately deviated wells.

The mud, after being deflocculated, usually shows much improved filter-cake qualities with lower yield point and gel strengths. Filter-cake quality is improved because when clays are deflocculated, the platelets become detached from each other and can lie flat to form a thin, low-permeability filter cake. Lowering yield point and gel strength may not always be desired and can be adjusted by the amount of deflocculant added in each treatment.

Sonic logs that do not record waveforms measure the acoustic traveltime between transmitter and receiver by detecting the first signal at the receiver above a certain threshold (first motion detection). The threshold is small so that the signal is detected just after it crosses the zero signal baseline. However, if the threshold is set too high, or the signal is too small, the system will not trigger at the sharp zero crossing but at some later point on the waveform. This increases the apparent transmitter-receiver time. Delta-t stretch is more likely at the far receiver, where signals are weaker, so that the apparent traveltime calculated between receivers is too large.

After zeroing the depth on surface, the depth wheel provides the depth input to the recording system. Small errors in calibration and slippage can cause the wheel to introduce systematic errors in the depth recorded. For this reason, the depth is checked and corrected using depth marks.

[Formation Evaluation]\n\nReferring to a borehole-compensation scheme for sonic logs that combines measurements taken when the logging tool is at two different depths in the borehole. In normal borehole-compensation schemes, the effects of caves and sonde tilt are minimized by combining measurements from a second transmitter (T2) above a pair of receivers with those from the first transmitter (T1) below the receivers. This arrangement makes the logging tool unacceptably long for the long-spacing sonic log. In the depth-derived system, T2 is located below T1, at a distance equal to the receiver spacing. T1 is fired and the transit time between the receivers at depth z (TT1z) is recorded as usual. Then when T1 and T2 are at depth z, both are fired sequentially and the difference in time for their signals to reach one of the receivers is recorded (TT2z).

In a typical trip out of the hole (TOH), the derrickman wears a special safety harness that enables him to lean out from the work platform (called the monkeyboard) to reach the drillpipe in the center of the derrick or mast, throw a line around the pipe and pull it back into its storage location (the fingerboards) until it is time to run the pipe back into the well. In terms of skill, physical exertion and perceived danger, a derrickman has one of the most demanding jobs on the rig crew.

The diameter of invasion affects whether a log measures the invaded zone, the undisturbed zone, or part of each zone. The term is closely related to the depth of invasion, being twice the depth of invasion plus the borehole diameter. Diameter of invasion is a more appropriate parameter for describing the response of azimuthally symmetric measurements such as induction, laterolog and propagation resistivity.\n\nThe term is well-defined in the case of a step profile of invasion.

At the frequency used, water molecules have a strong effect on the dielectric properties, so that both relative dielectric permittivity and conductivity increase with the volume of water present. Relative dielectric permittivity can be used to distinguish hydrocarbons from water of any salinity. However, the effect of salinity is more important than the salinity effect with the high-frequency electromagnetic propagation log, and the interpretation is more complex.

  "direct-indicating viscometer": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nThe instrument used to measure viscosity and gel strength of drilling mud. The direct-indicating viscometer is a rotational cylinder and bob instrument, also known as a V-G meter. Two speeds of rotation, 300 and 600 rpm, are available in all instruments, but some are 6- or variable-speed. It is called \"direct-indicating\" because at a given speed, the dial reading is a true centipoise viscosity. For example, at 300 rpm, the dial reading (511 sec-1) is a true viscosity. Bingham plastic rheological parameters are easily calculated from direct-indicating viscometer readings: PV (in units of cP) = 600 dial - 300 dial and YP (in units of lbm/100 ft2) = 300 dial - PV. Gel strength is also directly read as dial readings in oilfield units of lbm/100 ft2.\n\nSynonyms:\nFann viscometer\n\nSee:\nBingham plastic model, deflocculant, gel strength, Herschel–Bulkley fluid, Newtonian fluid, non-Newtonian fluid, plastic viscosity, power-law fluid, rheological property, yield point",
  "directional driller": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn individual trained in the science and art of intentionally drilling a well along a predetermined path in three-dimensional space, usually involving deviating the well from vertical and directing it in a specific compass direction or heading. The directional driller considers such parameters as rotary speed, weight on bit, control drilling and when to stop drilling and take surveys of the wellpath, and works closely with the toolpusher.\n\nAlternate Form:\nDD\n\nSee:\ndeviation, directional drilling, toolpusher",
  "directional drilling": "1. n. [Drilling, Shale Gas]\n\nThe intentional deviation of a wellbore from the path it would naturally take. This is accomplished through the use of whipstocks, bottomhole assembly (BHA) configurations, instruments to measure the path of the wellbore in three-dimensional space, data links to communicate measurements taken downhole to the surface, mud motors and special BHA components and drill bits, including rotary steerable systems, and drill bits. The directional driller also exploits drilling parameters such as weight on bit and rotary speed to deflect the bit away from the axis of the existing wellbore. In some cases, such as drilling steeply dipping formations or unpredictable deviation in conventional drilling operations, directional-drilling techniques may be employed to ensure that the hole is drilled vertically. While many techniques can accomplish this, the general concept is simple: point the bit in the direction that one wants to drill. The most common way is through the use of a bend near the bit in a downhole steerable mud motor. The bend points the bit in a direction different from the axis of the wellbore when the entire drillstring is not rotating. By pumping mud through the mud motor, the bit turns while the drillstring does not rotate, allowing the bit to drill in the direction it points. When a particular wellbore direction is achieved, that direction may be maintained by rotating the entire drillstring (including the bent section) so that the bit does not drill in a single direction off the wellbore axis, but instead sweeps around and its net direction coincides with the existing wellbore. Rotary steerable tools allow steering while rotating, usually with higher rates of penetration and ultimately smoother boreholes. Directional drilling is common in shale reservoirs because it allows drillers to place the borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock.\nFor more details, see The Defining Series: Elements of Hydraulic Fracturing.

  "directional permeability": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nPermeability that varies with direction of flow through the porous medium. Lateral permeability contrast can be particularly important in fractured formations, where effective permeability in the direction of the fractures may be many times greater than the matrix permeability. If the permeability in one direction is significantly more than in the other, the flow pattern may more closely approximate linear flow than radial flow. This can be detected from well-test data.\n\nLikewise, laminations in most clastic formations cause the permeability normal to the bedding plane to be less than the lateral permeability parallel to bedding. This is called vertical to horizontal permeability anisotropy.\n\nSee:\nbed, isotropic permeability, lamination, linear flow",
  "directional survey": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA completed measurement of the inclination and azimuth of a location in a well (typically the total depth at the time of measurement). In both directional and straight holes, the position of the well must be known with reasonable accuracy to ensure the correct wellbore path and to know its position in the event a relief well must be drilled. The measurements themselves include inclination from vertical, and the azimuth (or compass heading) of the wellbore if the direction of the path is critical. These measurements are made at discrete points in the well, and the approximate path of the wellbore computed from the discrete points. Measurement devices range from simple pendulum-like devices to complex electronic accelerometers and gyroscopes used more often as MWD becomes more popular. In simple pendulum measurements, the position of a freely hanging pendulum relative to a measurement grid (attached to the housing of the tool and assumed to represent the path of the wellbore) is captured on photographic film.

Receivers in the form of groups in which the individual geophones or hydrophones are separated from each other in linear (1D) or areal (2D) arrays are directional, and are designed to suppress signal arriving nearly horizontally and to pass nearly vertical arrivals with minimum attenuation or distortion.

This is accomplished by pumping a spacer fluid that is benign to both the first and second fluid, followed by the new fluid, down the drillstring and out the bottom of the drillstring or bit. While the spacer and second fluid are pumped into the top of the wellbore, the first fluid is forced out of the annulus between the drillstring and the wellbore or casing. In some cases, this general procedure may be reversed by pumping in the top of the annulus and taking fluid back from the drillstring.

  "drainage volume": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nThe portion of the volume of a reservoir drained by a well. In a reservoir drained by multiple wells, the volume ultimately drained by any given well is proportional to that well's production rate:\n\nVi = Vt x qi/qt, where Vi is the drainage volume of Well i, Vt is the entire drainage volume of the reservoir, qi is the production rate from Well i, and qt is the total production rate from the reservoir.\n\nSee:\ndrainage area, well production rate",

  "drawdown test": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nThe measurement and analysis of pressure data taken after a well is put on production, either initially or following an extended shut-in period. Drawdown data are usually noisy, meaning that the pressure moves up and down as fluid flows past the gauges and minute variations in flow rate take place. This is especially true for new wells, in which well cleanup commonly occurs for days after production has begun. Such data are difficult to interpret, and the noise often obscures regions of interest to the analyst. Transient downhole flow rates measured while flowing can be used to correct pressure variations through convolution or deconvolution calculations that enable diagnosis and interpretation, analogous to that done for the pressure change and derivative.\n\nSee:\nbuildup test",

The drilling line is reeled over the crown block and traveling block to gain mechanical advantage in a \"block and tackle\" or \"pulley\" fashion. This reeling out and in of the drilling line causes the traveling block, and whatever may be hanging underneath it, to be lowered into or raised out of the wellbore.

  "drill bit": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe tool used to crush or cut rock. Everything on a drilling rig directly or indirectly assists the bit in crushing or cutting the rock. The bit is on the bottom of the drillstring and must be changed when it becomes excessively dull or stops making progress.

  "drill collar": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA component of a drillstring that provides weight on bit for drilling. Drill collars are thick-walled tubular pieces machined from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys.\nThe bars of steel are drilled from end to end to provide a passage to pumping drilling fluids through the collars. The outside diameter of the steel bars may be machined slightly to ensure roundness, and in some cases may be machined with helical grooves (\"spiral collars\"). Last, threaded connections, male on one end and female on the other, are cut so multiple collars can be screwed together along with other downhole tools to make a bottomhole assembly (BHA). Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off the bottom of the wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20, 000 lbm [9, 080 kg] less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20, 000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Downhole MWD sensors measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.\n\nSee:\nbottomhole assembly, circulation system, collar, drilling fluid, keyseat, measurements-while-drilling, outside diameter, saver sub, sub, weight indicator",

  "drilling break": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA sudden increase in the rate of penetration during drilling. When this increase is significant (two or more times the normal speed, depending on local conditions), it may indicate a formation change, a change in the pore pressure of the formation fluids, or both. It is commonly interpreted as an indication of the bit drilling sand (high-speed drilling) rather than shale (low-speed drilling). The fast-drilling formation may or may not contain high-pressure fluids. Therefore, the driller commonly stops drilling and performs a flow check to determine if the formation is flowing. If the well is flowing, or if the results are uncertain, the driller may close the blowout preventers or circulate bottoms-up. Depending on the bit being used and the formations being drilled, a formation, even if sand, may sometimes drill slower rather than faster. This slowing of drilling progress, while technically also a drilling break, is usually referred to as a \"reverse drilling break\", or simply \"reverse break.\"\n\nSee:\nblowout preventer, formation fluid, pore pressure, rate of penetration",

  "drillstem test": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA procedure to determine the productive capacity, pressure, permeability or extent (or a combination of these) of a hydrocarbon reservoir. While several different proprietary hardware sets are available to accomplish this, the common idea is to isolate the zone of interest with temporary packers. Next, one or more valves are opened to produce the reservoir fluids through the drillpipe and allow the well to flow for a time. Finally, the operator kills the well, closes the valves, removes the packers and trips the tools out of the hole. Depending on the requirements and goals for the test, it may be of short (one hour or less) or long (several days or weeks) duration and there might be more than one flow period and pressure buildup period.\n\nAlternate Form:\nDST\n\nSee:\nbarefoot, flow period, kill, packer, pressure buildup, safety joint, trip out\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Testing]\n\nWell tests conducted with the drillstring still in the hole. Often referred to as DST, these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve. One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the annulus between the drillstring and the casing, thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. With low-permeability formations, or where the production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottomhole valve is opened. These tests are called closed-chamber tests.\n\nDrillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased prior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, so obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. Also, pressure is at its highest point, and the reservoir fluids may contain hydrogen sulfide, so these tests can carry considerable risk for rig personnel.\n\nThe most common test sequence consists of a short flow period, perhaps five or ten minutes, followed by a buildup period of about an hour that is used to determine initial reservoir pressure. This is followed by a flow period of 4 to 24 hours to establish stable flow to the surface, if possible, and followed by the final shut-in or buildup test that is used to determine permeability thickness and flow potential.\n\nSee:\nbottomhole shut-in, buildup test, closed-chamber testing, DST, final shut-in period, flow period, formation pressure, hydrogen sulfide, packer, permeability thickness, pressure gauge, produced fluid, reservoir pressure",

  "DST": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nWell tests conducted with the drillstring still in the hole. Often referred to as DST, these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve. One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed. The tool includes a surface-actuated packer that can isolate the formation from the annulus between the drillstring and the casing, thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring. By closing in the well at the bottom, afterflow is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates. The drillstring is sometimes filled with an inert gas, usually nitrogen, for these tests. With low-permeability formations, or where the production is mostly water and the formation pressure is too low to lift water to the surface, surface production may never be observed. In these cases, the volume of fluids produced into the drillstring is calculated and an analysis can be made without obtaining surface production. Occasionally, operators may wish to avoid surface production entirely for safety or environmental reasons, and produce only that amount that can be contained in the drillstring. This is accomplished by closing the surface valve when the bottomhole valve is opened. These tests are called closed-chamber tests.\n\nDrillstem tests are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir. The formation often is not cased prior to these tests, and the contents of the reservoir are frequently unknown at this point, so obtaining fluid samples is usually a major consideration. Also, pressure is at its highest point, and the reservoir fluids may contain hydrogen sulfide, so these tests can carry considerable risk for rig personnel.\nThe most common test sequence consists of a short flow period, perhaps 5 or 10 minutes, followed by a buildup period of about an hour that is used to determine initial reservoir pressure. This is followed by a flow period of 4 to 24 hours to establish stable flow to the surface, if possible, and followed by the final shut-in or buildup test that is used to determine permeability thickness and flow potential.\n\nAlternate Form:\ndrillstem test",
  "DST pressure chart": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nThe characteristic plot of pressure versus time obtained from the mechanical recording of pressure gauges in a DST tool.

Pressure drops immediately upon opening of the downhole valve to match the pressure in the drillstring, and then rises as fluid flows into the string.

[Formation Evaluation]\n\nA model of shaly formations that considers there to be two waters in the pore space: far water, which is the normal formation water; and near water (or clay-bound water) in the electrical double layer near the clay surface.\nThe clay-bound water consists of clay counter-ions and the associated water of hydration. The volume of this layer is determined by its thickness, which is constant at high salinities, and its area, which is proportional to the counter-ion concentration per unit pore volume (Qv). The volume of clay-bound water per unit pore volume, Swb, can therefore be written as:\nSwb = alpha * vq * Qv\nwhere vq = 0.28 cm3/meq at 25oC is the factor relating volume to counter-ion concentration at high salinity and is a function only of temperature, and alpha = 1 above a certain salinity, below which it increases with temperature and with decreasing salinity.\nThe dual-water concept was developed for the interpretation of resistivity in shaly sands, but is also useful in the interpretation of nuclear and nuclear magnetic resonance logs.

  "electromagnetic caliper": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nAn in-situ measurement of the inside diameter of a casing or tubing using an electromagnetic technique. As with the electromagnetic thickness measurement, and usually measured at the same time, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. At high frequency, the signal penetrates less than a tenth of a millimeter into the casing, and the phase shift can be related to the casing internal diameter.\nUnlike a mechanical or ultrasonic caliper, the measurement does not respond to nonmagnetic scale. For the purpose of determining the true internal diameter, this is a disadvantage, but for the purpose of determining corrosion, it is an advantage.\n\nSee:\ncasing-inspection log, casing-potential profile, electromagnetic thickness, inside diameter, multifinger caliper, phase shift, ultrasonic caliper",
  "electromagnetic heating": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA process to increase thermal energy in a reservoir using electromagnetic means. The two types of electromagnetic heating are conductive and radio frequency (RF). In conductive heating, a current passes from one electrode through the formation to a second electrode. Electrical resistance of the reservoir brine generates thermal energy, heating the reservoir. In RF heating, transmitters in the wellbore generate electromagnetic waves with frequencies in the microwave range that are directed into the formation. The waves interact with water molecules, generating heat in much the same way a microwave oven does. Since both methods rely on water to transfer thermal energy to the reservoir, higher water saturation increases the efficiency of the heat transfer.",
  "electromagnetic method": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nA group of techniques in which natural or artificially generated electric or magnetic fields are measured at the Earth's surface or in boreholes in order to map variations in the Earth's electrical properties (resistivity, permeability or permittivity). Most applications of surface electromagnetic methods today are for mineral and groundwater exploration or for shallow environmental mapping. Electromagnetic or electrical logging is, however, the main technique used in oil exploration to measure the amount of hydrocarbons in the pores of underground reservoirs. Inductive electromagnetic (EM) methods include a variety of low frequency (a few Hz to several kHz) techniques deploying large or small wire coils at or near the surface. In older usage, \"electromagnetic method\" tended to refer only to inductive methods. This term is now commonly used for any method employing electromagnetic fields, including methods that use direct current (electrical or resistivity methods) and induced polarization (IP), methods that use microwave frequencies (ground-penetrating radar), and methods that use natural electromagnetic fields (magnetotelluric methods).\n\nSee:\narray, cultural noise, diffusion equation, dipole, eddy current, electrical conductivity, electrical permittivity, fixed-source method, geometric, induced polarization, magnetics, magnetotelluric method, Maxwell's equations, moving-source method, Occam's inversion, parametric, perpendicular offset, probe, reflection, skin depth, survey, transient electromagnetic method, transverse electric mode, transverse magnetic mode",

Logs made above 200 MHz and into the GHz range are known as electromagnetic propagation logs. Below about 100 kHz, the measurements are based on the properties of standing waves, not of propagation. Induction and laterolog tools work in this range.\n\nSee:\ndielectric propagation log, resistivity log",
  "electromagnetic propagation measurement": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA measurement of the high frequency (about 1 GHz) dielectric properties of the formation. In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array.\n\nAn ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake. Borehole compensation is used to correct for sonde tilt or a rough borehole wall.\n\nSee:\nconductivity, electromagnetic propagation, filtercake, relative dielectric permittivity, spreading loss",
  "electromagnetic thickness": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nAn in-situ measurement of the thickness of a casing or tubing string using an electromagnetic technique. The result is presented as a type of casing-inspection log, giving an estimate of metal loss and detecting corrosion. In the usual method, a coil centered inside the casing generates an alternating magnetic field. Another coil farther up the tool measures the phase shift introduced by the casing. This phase shift depends on the casing-wall thickness and internal diameter, as well as the casing conductivity and magnetic permeability. The effects change at different frequencies, so that by varying the frequency, the thickness and internal diameter can be uniquely determined.\nElectromagnetic thickness can also be measured using other techniques, for example from a casing-potential profile or a flux-leakage measurement.\n\nSee:\ncasing-inspection log, casing-potential profile, electromagnetic caliper, flux leakage, magnetic permeability, phase shift",
  "elemental capture spectroscopy": "1. adj.

The yields give information only on the relative concentration of these elements. To get absolute elemental concentrations, it is necessary to calibrate to cores, or, more often, use a model such as the oxide-closure model.\n\nThe depth of investigation of the measurement is several inches into the formation.

Long echo spacings, for example 3 s, cause diffusion relaxation to limit the maximum T2 from water. They also limit the maximum T2 from light hydrocarbons. However, there is a certain range of viscosity of medium oil that is less affected.

Density measurements require correction only for borehole size, while neutron porosity measurements require corrections for temperature, pressure and a large number of borehole and formation parameters. Not all corrections are significant in all cases. Corrections can be calculated manually, using charts, or applied through software. Conventionally, corrections are applied sequentially, as for example first borehole then invasion. In some situations, such as the combination of deep invasion and high apparent dip on a resistivity measurement, the corrections are too interdependent for sequential application to be accurate.

The slowing-down process is dominated by hydrogen, and is characterized by a slowing-down length. By measuring the neutrons at the epithermal level, rather than the thermal level, the response is a purer estimate of hydrogen index, unaffected by thermal absorbers.

This impingement velocity is not, however, the same as the exit velocity, since the high-energy fluid jet loses velocity through viscous losses and conversions from kinetic energy to forms of potential energy occur once the fluid leaves the bit.

In fast diffusion, the hydrogen within a certain volume diffuses fast enough that only one T2 peak is observed for the whole volume. This is the case in a single pore, because the surface relaxation is not strong enough for observation of separate T2 peaks, for example, for water near the surface of a grain and water in the middle of the pore.

In some formations, particularly carbonates of low porosity, it is possible that the first acoustic signal to arrive at the receiver passes through the formation rather than through the casing, and hence its amplitude is unrelated to the cement bond. This manifests itself by a shortening of the transmitter-to-receiver traveltime and by anomalous patterns on the variable-density log.

  "fault": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nA break or planar surface in brittle rock across which there is observable displacement. Depending on the relative direction of displacement between the rocks, or fault blocks, on either side of the fault, its movement is described as normal, reverse or strike-slip. According to terminology derived from the mining industry, the fault block above the fault surface is called the hanging wall, while the fault block below the fault is the footwall. Given the geological complexity of some faulted rocks and rocks that have undergone more than one episode of deformation, it can be difficult to distinguish between the various types of faults. Also, areas deformed more than once or that have undergone continual deformation might have fault surfaces that are rotated from their original orientations, so interpretation is not straightforward. In a normal fault, the hanging wall moves down relative to the footwall along the dip of the fault surface, which is steep, from 45o to 90o. A growth fault is a type of normal fault that forms during sedimentation and typically has thicker strata on the downthrown hanging wall than the footwall. A reverse fault forms when the hanging wall moves up relative to the footwall parallel to the dip of the fault surface. A thrust fault, sometimes called an overthrust, is a reverse fault in which the fault plane has a shallow dip, typically much less than 45o.\n\nMovement of normal and reverse faults can also be oblique as opposed to purely parallel to the dip direction of the fault plane. The motion along a strike-slip fault, also known as a transcurrent or wrench fault, is parallel to the strike of the fault surface, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. The fault surfaces of strike-slip faults are usually nearly vertical. A strike-slip fault in which the block across the fault moves to the right is described as a dextral strike-slip fault. If it moves left, the relative motion is described as sinistral. A transform fault is a particular type of strike-slip fault that is a boundary of an oceanic tectonic plate. The actual movement of a transform fault is opposite to its apparent displacement.\n\nThe presence of a fault can be detected by observing characteristics of rocks such as changes in lithology from one fault block to the next, breaks and offsets between strata or seismic events, and changes in formation pressure in wells that penetrate both sides of a fault. Some fault surfaces contain relatively coarse rubble that can act as a conduit for migrating oil or gas, whereas the surfaces of other faults are smeared with impermeable clays or broken grains that can act as a fault seal.\n\nSee:\nanomaly, antithetic fault, aulacogen, cataclastic, collision, competent, decollement, en echelon, fault trap, flower structure, fracture, Global Positioning System, graben, growth fault, horst, incompetent, inversion, lithologic contact, normal fault, offset, orogeny, plate tectonics, reverse fault, sinistral, strain, strike-slip fault, structural trap, structure, synthetic fault, thrust fault, transform fault, transpression, transtension, two-dimensional survey, wrench fault",

The injection pattern for an individual field or part of a field is based on the location of existing wells, reservoir size and shape, cost of new wells and the recovery increase associated with various injection patterns. The flood pattern can be altered during the life of a field to change the direction of flow in a reservoir with the intent of contacting unswept oil. It is common to reduce the pattern size by infill drilling, which improves oil recovery by increasing reservoir continuity between injectors and producers.\n\nCommon injection patterns are direct line drive, staggered line drive, two-spot, three-spot, four-spot, five-spot, seven-spot and nine-spot. Normally, the two-spot and three-spot patterns are used for pilot testing purposes. The patterns are called normal or regular when they include only one production well per pattern.

[Well Workover and Intervention]\n\n\nThe design, strategies and principles for ensuring that there is uninterrupted hydrocarbon production flowing from the reservoir to the point of sale. Impediments to hydrocarbon flow in wellbores and flowlines may arise from an interrelated combination of effects involving flow dynamics—single and multiphase fluid flow—and production chemistry. At reservoir pressure and temperature conditions, fluids are single phase. As they travel toward the production facility, the fluids experience changes in pressure and temperature that result in multiple fluid phases and the formation, accumulation and dispersal of inorganic and organic solids that may become impediments to production. Multiphase flow may cause phenomena such as slugging in subsea flowlines and risers. Solids deposition may cause flowline plugging anywhere in the system.\nHistorically, production impediments in wellbores and flowlines are well-known in onshore and shallow water environments, where they have been managed using thermal, mechanical and chemical means. The long flowlines connecting a wellhead or manifold to a production facility are exposed to low temperatures and high pressures.

In the field, fluoboric acid [HBF4] is easily prepared by mixing boric acid [H3BO3], ammonium bifluoride [NH3F.HF] and hydrochloric acid. Fluoboric acid was developed to counteract the shortcomings associated with mud-acid treatments. It is a retarded fluid that can penetrate deep into the reservoir before spending, especially at high temperatures, and does not contain high HF at any given time. Thus, it is less reactive than mud acid, but its total dissolving power is comparable:\n\nHBF4 + H3O --> HBF3OH + HF.\n\nThe limited amount of HF at any given time decreases the probability of forming precipitates of fluosilicates, fluoaluminates or silica. Fluoboric acid provides permanent stabilization of clays and fines through reactions related to borate and fluoborate ions. For example, borosilicates coat and bind undissolved clays and fines, preventing further mobility of these particles that might plug the formation and impair production. Mud acid does not provide this coating feature. Fluoboric acid also eliminates water sensitivity and is especially recommended in formations containing potassium minerals.\n\nFluoboric acid can be used as a preflush, an overflush or as a main stage in a sandstone matrix acidizing. As a main fluid, a fluoboric acid treatment requires a preflush (weak HCl acid or brine) and should not be overflushed to obtain the maximum stabilization effect in the critical matrix area.

  "flux leakage": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA distortion of the magnetic flux that has been introduced into a casing by a low-frequency electromagnet or permanent magnet. The principle of flux leakage is used to detect casing corrosion, since flux leakage is caused by rapid changes in the thickness of the casing and by pits and holes in either the internal or external wall. Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall.

  "foamy oil": "1. n. [Heavy Oil]\n\nAn oil-continuous foam that contains dispersed gas bubbles produced at the wellhead from heavy oil reservoirs under solution gas drive. The nature of the gas dispersions in oil distinguishes foamy oil behavior from conventional heavy oil.

A syncline is the opposite type of fold, having downwardly convex layers with young rocks in the core. Folds typically occur in anticline-syncline pairs. The hinge is the point of maximum curvature in a fold. The limbs occur on either side of the fold hinge. The imaginary surface bisecting the limbs of the fold is called the axial surface. The axial surface is called the axial plane in cases where the fold is symmetrical and the lines containing the points of maximum curvature of the folded layers, or hinge lines, are coplanar.

  "formation damage": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAlteration of the far-field or virgin characteristics of a producing formation, usually by exposure to drilling fluids. The water or solid particles in the drilling fluids, or both, tend to decrease the pore volume and effective permeability of the producible formation in the near-wellbore region. At least two mechanisms are at work. First, solid particles from the drilling fluid physically plug or bridge across flowpaths in the porous formation. Second, when water contacts certain clay minerals in the formation, the clay typically swells, increasing in volume and decreasing the pore volume. Third, chemical reactions between the drilling fluid and the formation rock and fluids can precipitate solids or semisolids that plug pore spaces. One approach to minimize formation damage is to use drill-in or completion fluids that are specially formulated to avoid damage to the formation when drilling pay zones, rather than ordinary drilling fluids.\n\nSee:\nbridge, completion fluid, drill-in fluid, drilling fluid\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA reduction in the natural capability of a reservoir to produce its fluids, such as a decrease in porosity or permeability, or both. Damage can occur near the wellbore face (easier to repair) or deep into the rock (harder to repair). Damage is caused by several mechanisms: (1) physical plugging of pores by mud solids, (2) alteration of reservoir rock wettability, (3) precipitation of insoluble materials in pore spaces, (4) clay swelling in pore spaces, (5) migration of fines into pore throats, (6) introduction of an immobile phase, and (7) emulsion formation and blockage. Damage can occur when sensitive formations are exposed to drilling fluids.\n\nSee:\nbridging material, completion fluid, drill-in fluid, drilling fluid, emulsion, fines, pore throat, scale\n\n\n\n\n3. n. [Well Completions]\n\nA general term to describe the reduction in permeability to the near-wellbore area of a reservoir formation. There are several recognized damage mechanisms, such as the invasion of incompatible fluids swelling the formation clays, or fine solids from dirty fluids plugging the formation matrix.

[Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nNatural or induced production impairments that can develop in the reservoir, the near-wellbore area or the perforations. Natural damage occurs as produced reservoir fluids move through the reservoir, while induced damage is the result of external operations and fluids in the well, such as drilling, well completion, workover operations or stimulation treatments. Some induced damage triggers natural damage mechanisms.\n\nNatural damage includes phenomena such as fines migration, clay swelling, scale formation, organic deposition, including paraffins or asphaltenes, and mixed organic and inorganic deposition. Induced damage includes plugging caused by foreign particles in the injected fluid, wettability changes, emulsions, precipitates or sludges caused by acid reactions, bacterial activity and water blocks.\n\nWellbore cleanup or matrix stimulation treatments are two different operations that can remove natural or induced damage. Selecting the proper operation depends on the location and nature of the damage.\n\nSee:\nclay swelling, damage, emulsion, fines migration, matrix stimulation, paraffin control, scale removal, water block",

  "formation evaluation while drilling": "1. n. [Drilling, Shale Gas]\n\nAlso known as logging while drilling or LWD, the measurement of formation properties during the excavation of the hole, or shortly thereafter, through the use of tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly.\n\nLWD, while sometimes risky and expensive, has the advantage of measuring properties of a formation before drilling fluids invade deeply. Further, many wellbores prove to be difficult or even impossible to measure with conventional wireline tools, especially highly deviated wells. In these situations, the LWD measurement ensures that some measurement of the subsurface is captured in the event that wireline operations are not possible.\n\nTimely LWD data can also be used to guide well placement so that the wellbore remains within the zone of interest or in the most productive portion of a reservoir, such as in highly variable shale reservoirs.\n\nSee:\nbottomhole assembly, deviated hole, measurements-while-drilling, wireline log",

Archie postulated that the formation factor (F) was a constant independent of Rw and solely a function of pore geometry (the Archie equation I). It has since been shown that F is independent of Rw only for a certain class of petrophysically simple rocks (Archie rocks). In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, there is a more complex dependence. In such cases, the ratio Ro/Rw is known as the apparent formation factor and may vary with Rw, temperature and the type of ion in solution. The intrinsic formation factor is then defined as F corrected for the effect of shale, or else the value of Ro/Rw at the limit of high salinity (low Rw ). The correction for the effect of shale depends on the saturation equation used, for example Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM. Unless otherwise stated, the term formation factor usually refers to the apparent formation factor.\n\nF has been related to porosity (phi) by several formulae (Archie, Humble and others) that have the general expression F = a / phim, where a is a constant and m the porosity exponent.\n\nSee:\nArchie equation, Archie rock, dual water, Humble formula, laminated sand, porosity exponent, tortuosity",

  "fracture": "1. n. [Shale Gas, Geology]\n\nA crack or surface of breakage within rock not related to foliation or cleavage in metamorphic rock along which there has been no movement. A fracture along which there has been displacement is a fault. When walls of a fracture have moved only normal to each other, the fracture is called a joint. Fractures can enhance permeability of rocks greatly by connecting pores together, and for that reason, fractures are induced mechanically in some reservoirs in order to boost hydrocarbon flow.\n\nFractures may also be referred to as natural fractures to distinguish them from fractures induced as part of a reservoir stimulation or drilling operation. In some shale reservoirs, natural fractures improve production by enhancing effective permeability. In other cases, natural fractures can complicate reservoir stimulation.\n\nSee:\ncompetent, dilatancy, en echelon, fracture gradient, halite, incompetent, permeability, pore, S-wave, strain, structure\n\n\n\n\n2. vb. [Shale Gas, Well Completions]\n\nTo perform a stimulation treatment, which is routine for oil and gas wells in low-permeability reservoirs. Specially engineered fluids are pumped at high pressure and rate into the reservoir interval to be treated, causing a vertical fracture to open. The wings of the fracture extend away from the wellbore in opposing directions according to the natural stresses within the formation. Proppant, such as grains of sand of a particular size, is mixed with the treatment fluid to keep the fracture open when the treatment is complete. Hydraulic fracturing creates high-conductivity communication with a large area of formation and bypasses any damage that may exist in the near-wellbore area.\n\nSee:\nhydraulic fracturing, treatment fluid",
  "fracture acidizing": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA well-stimulation operation in which acid, usually hydrochloric [HCl], is injected into a carbonate formation at a pressure above the formation-fracturing pressure. Flowing acid tends to etch the fracture faces in a nonuniform pattern, forming conductive channels that remain open without a propping agent after the fracture closes.\n\nThe length of the etched fracture limits the effectiveness of an acid-fracture treatment. The fracture length depends on acid leakoff and acid spending. If acid fluid-loss characteristics are poor, excessive leakoff will terminate fracture extension. Similarly, if the acid spends too rapidly, the etched portion of the fracture will be too short. The major problem in fracture acidizing is the development of wormholes in the fracture face; these wormholes increase the reactive surface area and cause excessive leakoff and rapid spending of the acid. To some extent, this problem can be overcome by using inert fluid-loss additives to bridge wormholes or by using viscosified acids. Fracture acidizing is also called acid fracturing or acid-fracture treatment.\n\nSee:\nacid frac, fluid loss, formation fracture pressure, hydraulic fracturing, matrix stimulation",

In many cases of gas lock, this increase in bottomhole pressure can exceed the pressure in the barrel and liquid can enter through the standing valve.

It can also be a differential geometrical factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance; or integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance.\n\nThe term geometrical factor was introduced for induction logging since it gave a convenient method for computing the reading in a heterogeneous environment.

  "hydrogen embrittlement": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nThe process whereby hydrogen causes steel components to become less resistant to breakage and generally much weaker in tensile strength. While embrittlement has many causes, in the oil field it is usually the result of exposure to gaseous or liquid hydrogen sulfide [H2S].\n\nOn a molecular level, hydrogen ions work their way between the grain boundaries of the steel, where hydrogen ions recombine into molecular hydrogen [H2], taking up more space and weakening the bonds between the grains. The formation of molecular hydrogen can cause sudden metal failure due to cracking when the metal is subjected to tensile stress.\n\nThis type of hydrogen-induced failure is produced when hydrogen atoms enter high strength steels. The failures due to hydrogen embrittlement normally have a period where no damage is observed, which is called incubation, followed by a sudden catastrophic failure.\n\nHydrogen embrittlement is also called acid brittleness.\n\nSee:\ncorrosion control, hydrogen-induced failures, tensile strength",

[Drilling, Drilling Fluids, Production Facilities, Well Testing, Well Workover and Intervention, Well Completions]\n\n[H2S]\nAn extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual.\nHydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas.\nHydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing.\nSulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.\n\nAlternate Form:\nH2S\n\nSee:\ncorrosion coupon, Garrett Gas Train, hydrocarbon, natural gas, sour, sweet",

[Drilling]\n\nThe vertical height of a fluid column, regardless of the length or other dimensions of that fluid column. For example, a deviated wellbore has a longer length than vertical depth. The hydrostatic head at any point in that wellbore is not a function of its measured depth (MD) along the wellbore axis, but rather its vertical distance or true vertical depth (TVD) to the surface. The term \"head\" or \"hydrostatic head\" is also commonly used as a measure of the output of centrifugal pumps, usually expressed in \"feet of head\" or psi. Since this type of pump is a centrifugal (or \"velocity\") device, the capability of the pump as expressed in feet of head is independent of the density of the fluid being pumped. For example, if a pump is rated as producing \"sixty feet of head, \" it will pump a column of fluid up an open-ended vertical pipe until the top of the liquid is 60 ft [18 m] above the discharge of the pump, regardless of the density of the liquid being pumped.\n\nSee:\ncirculation loss, deviated hole, hydrostatic pressure, measured depth, true vertical depth (TVD)",

Controlling the hydrostatic pressure of a mud column is a critical part of mud engineering. Mud weight must be monitored and adjusted to always stay within the limits imposed by the drilling situation. Sufficient hydrostatic pressure (mud weight) is necessary to prevent an influx of fluids from downhole, but excessive pressure must also be avoided to prevent creation of hydraulic fractures in the formation, which would cause lost circulation. Hydrostatic pressure is calculated from mud weight and true vertical depth as follows:Hydrostatic pressure, psi = 0.052 x Mud Weight, lbm/gal x True Vertical Depth, ft.

  "invasion": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe process by which mud filtrate, and sometimes whole mud, enters a permeable formation. The mud filtrate displaces some or all of the moveable fluids in the formation, leaving an invaded zone. The invasion process is complex. It is generally considered to start with a short initial spurt loss when the bit penetrates the rock. During this period, invasion depends on formation permeability, among other factors. A mudcake is soon formed, after which invasion is either described as dynamic, when mud is being circulated, or static, when it is not. In both cases, the volume of invasion depends little on formation properties and strongly on other factors such as mudcake permeability and differential pressure.\n\nHowever, the profile of the invasion front within the formation, both vertically and radially, does depend on formation properties. With high permeability and with different densities of filtrate and formation fluid, gravity can cause vertical movement of the filtrate, leading to different depths of invasion at the top and bottom of a zone. With two moveable phases (oil and water) and differing permeabilities, an annulus can be formed. The radial profile from the wellbore out to the undisturbed zone depends on permeability, with lower permeabilities leading to sharper transitions.\n\nSee:\nfiltrate slump, flushed zone, formation fluid, invaded zone, moved hydrocarbons, transition zone, undisturbed zone\n\n\n\n\n2. adj.

A typical inverse problem in electromagnetics is to determine the variation of electrical conductivity in the Earth from measurements of induced electric and magnetic fields.

A clean, dry sample is weighed and then evacuated for several hours in a vacuum chamber, flushing with CO2 to remove remaining air if necessary. A de-aerated liquid is introduced into the chamber and pressured to ensure complete saturation. The saturated sample is then weighed again. The difference in weight divided by the density of the liquid is the connected, or effective, pore volume.\n\nIt is also common to measure the weight of the sample when immersed in the liquid.

Typically there are four or more sensors, or probes, held on arms to measure the four quadrants of the well cross-section. The probes may be electrical, to distinguish hydrocarbon from water; optical, mainly to distinguish gas from liquid, but also oil from water; or dielectric, mainly to distinguish water from hydrocarbon, but also, with less resolution, oil from gas. They can detect bubbles that are larger than about 1 mm diameter. Their response is essentially digital, indicating either one fluid or the other, so that the percentage of time that they see a fluid is a direct measure of its holdup.

  "log": "1. vb. [Reservoir Characterization, Formation Evaluation, Drilling]\n\nTo continuously measure formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include electrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies), sonic properties, active and passive nuclear measurements, dimensional measurements of the wellbore, formation fluid sampling, formation pressure measurement, wireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools, and others. For wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string (link to ID 2964) has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, \"down log\" measurements might be conducted on the way into the well, and repeated on the way out if possible.) Most wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.\n\nSee:\nhostile environment, wireline log\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe measurement versus depth or time, or both, of one or more physical quantities in or around a well. The term comes from the word \"log\" used in the sense of a record or a note. Wireline logs are taken downhole, transmitted through a wireline to surface and recorded there. Measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD) logs are also taken downhole. They are either transmitted to surface by mud pulses, or else recorded downhole and retrieved later when the instrument is brought to surface. Mud logs that describe samples of drilled cuttings are taken and recorded on surface.\nFor more details, see The Defining Series: Introduction to Wireline Logging.\n\nSynonyms:\nwell log\n\nSee:\nreal-time data, recorded data\n\n\n\n\n3. n.

The term is used in three different ways. First, the term refers to logging operations performed at different times during the drilling of a well. For example, Run 3 would be the third time logs had been recorded in that well. Second, the term refers to the number of times a particular log has been run in the well. Third, the term refers to different runs performed during the same logging operation.

[3.8 to 12.7 cm] in diameter. Since the total length is more than can be conveniently handled in one piece, the logging tool is divided into different sections that are assembled at the wellsite. These sections consist of cartridges and sondes. Different measurements can be combined to make up a tool string. The total length of a tool string may range from 10 to 100 ft [3 to 30 m] or more. Flexible joints are added in long tool strings to ease passage in the borehole, and to allow different sections to be centralized or eccentralized.

Further, many wellbores prove to be difficult or even impossible to measure with conventional wireline tools, especially highly deviated wells. In these situations, the LWD measurement ensures that some measurement of the subsurface is captured in the event that wireline operations are not possible.\n\nTimely LWD data can also be used to guide well placement so that the wellbore remains within the zone of interest or in the most productive portion of a reservoir, such as in highly variable shale reservoirs.\n\nAlternate Form:\nLWD\n\nSee:\nbottomhole assembly, deviated hole, formation evaluation while drilling, measurements-while-drilling, wireline log",

The increased spacing permits the wave traveling through the true formation to arrive first and be measured. The depth of investigation varies with slowness and transmitter-receiver spacing but is of the order of 2 to 3 ft. An increased transmitter-to-receiver spacing also allows better separation of waveforms relating to different acoustic waves, such as compressional, shear and Stoneley arrivals.\n\nSee:\nfull waveform, sonic log, sonic measurement",

Flux leakage distorts the magnetic-flux lines and induces a signal into an electric coil moving past it. In-situ flux-leakage measurements make use of this effect by placing coils on or close to the casing wall, azimuthally distributed to cover the entire wall.

These natural EM fields are generated (at all frequencies) in the Earth's atmosphere mainly by lightning strokes and by interactions between the solar wind and the ionosphere. In the most general MT method, the horizontal components of the electric field and all three components of the magnetic field are measured at the surface. The measurements are used to determine specific ratios of electric to magnetic field components called tensor impedances. The technique was introduced the French geophysicist Louis Cagniard in the 1950s and has been popular for mineral exploration and regional geophysical mapping. It is used in oil exploration for low-cost reconnaissance of sedimentary basins and for exploration in areas where seismic surveys are difficult because of severe topography or the presence high-impedance volcanic rocks near the surface. The resolution of MT surveys is limited by the diffusive nature of EM propagation in the earth; it is usually on the order of hundreds of meters to kilometers.

The magnitude of the main magnetic field is nearly 60, 000 nT near the Earth’s poles and about 30, 000 nT near the equator. However, there are significant nondipole contributions to the main magnetic field that complicate its mathematical and graphical representation, including that the relative strengths of nondipole components change. As additional complications, the main field varies slowly because of changes within the Earth’s core and the magnetic dipole axis pole position itself wanders over time.\n\nSee:\ndipole field, nondipole field, crustal magnetic field, external disturbance field, local magnetic interference",
  "make a connection": "1. vb. [Drilling]\n\nTo add a length of drillpipe to the drillstring to continue drilling. In what is called jointed pipe drilling, joints of drillpipe, each about 30 ft [9 m] long, are screwed together as the well is drilled. When the bit on the bottom of the drillstring has drilled down to where the kelly or topdrive at the top of the drillstring nears the drillfloor, the drillstring between the two must be lengthened by adding a joint or a stand (usually three joints) to the drillstring. Once the rig crew is ready, the driller stops the rotary, picks up off bottom to expose a threaded connection below the kelly and turns the pumps off. The crew sets the slips to grip the drillstring temporarily, unscrews that threaded connection and screws the kelly (or topdrive) into the additional joint (or stand) of pipe. The driller picks that joint or stand up to allow the crew to screw the bottom of that pipe into the top of the temporarily hanging drillstring. The driller then picks up the entire drillstring to remove the slips, carefully lowers the drillstring while starting the pumps and rotary, and resumes drilling when the bit touches bottom.

Rapid corrective actions can often be implemented in order to deal with observed pressure variations. The MPD process may utilize a variety of techniques including control of back pressure, adjusting mud density, modifying fluid rheology, adjusting the annular fluid level, controlling circulating friction and incorporating hole geometry in the well construction.\nThe use of MPD to control the risks and costs of drilling wells that have narrow downhole pressure limits by actively managing the wellbore pressure profile has become a common practice.

A screen over the top removes large particles that might plug the tube.

Funnel viscosity is reported in seconds (for a quart). Water exits the funnel in about 26 seconds. This test was one of the earliest mud measurements for field use. Simple, quick and fool-proof, it still serves as a useful indicator of change in the mud by comparing mud-in and mud-out sample funnel viscosities.\n\nHallan N. Marsh of Los Angeles published the design and use of his funnel viscometer in 1931, and it is worth the time to read the detailed, often humorous, discussion that followed. Mr. Marsh was a forward thinking mud technologist in his day, as can be seen from the following words from his 1931 AIME paper: \"The subject of mud sounds so simple, uninteresting and unimportant that it has failed to receive the attention that it deserves, at least as applied to the drilling of oil wells. As a matter of fact, it is one of the most complicated, technical, important and interesting subjects in connection with rotary drilling.\"\nMr. Marsh was quoted by someone who knew him as saying (paraphrased), \"Of all the things I have done in mud technology, I am remembered for inventing this d*** funnel.\"\n\nReference:\nMarsh H: \"Properties and Treatment of Rotary Mud, \" Petroleum Development and Technology, Transactions of the AIME (1931): 234-251.\n\nSee:\nderrickman, funnel viscosity, gel strength, Marsh funnel viscosity, viscosity, viscosity and gel-strength test",

In sandstone formations, the acid reacts with the soluble substances in the formation matrix to enlarge the pore spaces. In carbonate formations, the acid dissolves the entire formation matrix. In each case, the matrix acidizing treatment improves the formation permeability to enable enhanced production of reservoir fluids. Matrix acidizing operations are ideally performed at high rate, but at treatment pressures below the fracture pressure of the formation. This enables the acid to penetrate the formation and extend the depth of treatment while avoiding damage to the reservoir formation.\n\nSynonyms:\nacid job, acid stimulation, acidize, acidizing, matrix stimulation\n\nSee:\nmatrix, stimulation fluid",
  "matrix stimulation": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention, Well Completions]\n\nA treatment designed to treat the near-wellbore reservoir formation rather than other areas of the production conduit, such as the casing across the production interval, production tubulars or the perforations. Matrix stimulation treatments include acid, solvent and chemical treatments to improve the permeability of the near-wellbore formation, enhancing the productivity of a well.\n\nMatrix stimulation is a process of injecting a fluid into the formation, either an acid or solvent at pressures below the fracturing pressure, to improve the production or injection flow capacity of a well. The goal of a matrix treatment is different in sandstones than in carbonates. In sandstones, matrix treatments restore or improve the natural formation permeability around the wellbore by removing formation damage, by dissolving material plugging the pores or by enlarging the pore spaces. In carbonates, matrix stimulation creates new, highly conductive channels (wormholes) that bypass damage.\n\nBecause of these differences, the selection criteria for the treating fluid are also distinct. For sandstone treatments, knowledge of the extent, type of damage, location, origin, reservoir mineralogy (petrographic study) and compatibility of the treating fluid with the formation are especially important. In carbonate treatments, reservoir temperature, pumping rate and fluid type become more significant because these parameters directly affect the reactivity of the treating fluid with the reservoir rock.\n\nA sandstone matrix stimulation treatment is generally composed of a hydrochloric acid [HCl] preflush, a main treating fluid (HCl-HF mixtures) and an overflush (weak acid solution or brine). The treating fluid is maintained under pressure inside the reservoir for a period of time, after which the well is swabbed and returned to production. In carbonate reservoirs, HCl is the most common fluid used. Organic acids such as formic and acetic acid are used in either sandstone or carbonate acidizing, mainly in retarded-acid systems or in high-temperature applications.\n\nMatrix stimulation is also called matrix treatment or matrix acidizing.\n\nSee:\nacid job, acid stimulation, acidize, acidizing, critical matrix, fracture acidizing, matrix, matrix acidizing",

Shales and clays are cationic membranes, since they allow the passage of cations, such as Na+, but not anions, such as Cl-. When the drilling mud in the borehole and the formation water have different salinities, a membrane potential is generated at the boundary between a shale and a permeable formation. This potential is one component of the electrochemical potential, from which the spontaneous potential (SP) log is derived. The other, much smaller component is the liquid-junction potential. The membrane potential is reduced if the shale is not a good cationic membrane, or in other words has a low cation-exchange capacity.\nA membrane potential may also be generated across the mudcake if there is no flushed zone; for example if the mud filtrate has moved vertically since invasion took place, and by clay within a shaly sand, but with the opposite polarity to the normal SP potentials.\nThe membrane potential is also used in core analysis to determine the cation-exchange capacity of a sample. In this case, the clay within the sample is the ion-selective membrane, and the potential generated across it is related to the cation-exchange capacity per unit pore volume, Qv. As a method of measuring Qv, the technique is faster than the multiple salinity method, and more representative of the in-situ value than destructive methods such as conductometric titration.

The texture of metamorphic rocks can vary from almost homogeneous, or nonfoliated, to foliated rocks with a strong planar fabric or foliation produced by alignment of minerals during recrystallization or by reorientation.

[Drilling Fluids]\n\nA crystalline solid consisting of water with methane molecules in an ice-like cage structure. The general term for this type of solid is clathrate. Water molecules form a lattice structure into which many types of gas molecules can fit. Most gases, except hydrogen and helium, can form hydrates. C1 to nC5 hydrocarbons, H2S and CO2 readily form hydrates at low temperature and high pressure. Heavier hydrocarbons may also enter the structure but do not form hydrates by themselves. Gas-cut muds can form hydrates in deepwater drilling operations, plugging BOP lines, risers and subsea wellheads, causing a well-control risk. Gas hydrates are thermodynamically suppressed by adding antifreeze materials such as salts or glycols. A common practice is to use 20 to 23 wt.% NaCl. Nucleation and growth of hydrates can be dynamically inhibited by certain polymers or surfactants. Gas hydrates are found in nature, on the bottom of cold seas and in arctic permafrost regions.

In the most general MT method, the horizontal components of the electric field and all three components of the magnetic field are measured at the surface. The measurements are used to determine specific ratios of electric to magnetic field components called tensor impedances. The technique was introduced the French geophysicist Louis Cagniard in the 1950s and has been popular for mineral exploration and regional geophysical mapping. It is used in oil exploration for low-cost reconnaissance of sedimentary basins and for exploration in areas where seismic surveys are difficult because of severe topography or the presence high-impedance volcanic rocks near the surface. The resolution of MT surveys is limited by the diffusive nature of EM propagation in the earth; it is usually on the order of hundreds of meters to kilometers.

MWD is now standard practice in offshore directional wells, where the tool cost is offset by rig time and wellbore stability considerations if other tools are used. The measurements are made downhole, stored in solid-state memory for some time and later transmitted to the surface. Data transmission methods vary from company to company, but usually involve digitally encoding data and transmitting to the surface as pressure pulses in the mud system. These pressures may be positive, negative or continuous sine waves. Some MWD tools have the ability to store the measurements for later retrieval with wireline or when the tool is tripped out of the hole if the data transmission link fails. MWD tools that measure formation parameters (resistivity, porosity, sonic velocity, gamma ray) are referred to as logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools.

  "neutron porosity": "1. adj. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nReferring to a log of porosity based on the effect of the formation on fast neutrons emitted by a source. Hydrogen has by far the biggest effect in slowing down and capturing neutrons. Since hydrogen is found mainly in the pore fluids, the neutron porosity log responds principally to porosity. However, the matrix and the type of fluid also have an effect. The log is calibrated to read the correct porosity assuming that the pores are filled with fresh water and for a given matrix (limestone, sandstone or dolomite). It is presented in units of porosity (vol/vol or p.u.) for the matrix chosen. Older logs were presented in counts per second or API units. The depth of investigation is several inches, so that the log reads mainly in the flushed zone.\n\nThe neutron porosity log is strongly affected by clay and gas. Hydrogen occurs in clays and hydrated minerals as well as pore fluids. Gas has a low hydrogen density, so that gas zones have a very low apparent porosity. The measurement is based on either thermal or epithermal neutron detection. Thermal neutrons have about the same energy as the surrounding matter, typically less than 0.4 eV, while epithermal neutrons have higher energy, between about 0.4 and 10 eV. Being a statistical measurement, the precision is greatest at high count rates, which in this case occurs at low porosity.\n\nNeutron porosity logs were introduced in the early 1940s. The first tools were known as neutron-gamma tools, since the detector measured the gamma rays emitted on capture. Neutron-neutron tools, using a thermal neutron detector were introduced in about 1950.\n\nSee:\nalpha processing, compensated neutron log, epithermal neutron porosity measurement, excavation effect, flushed zone, hydrogen index, limestone porosity unit, limestone-compatible scale, thermal neutron porosity measurement",

Under certain conditions, a non-Newtonian fluid flows as a liquid and under other conditions, it exhibits elasticity, plasticity and strength similar to a solid. In addition, unlike Newtonian fluids, the viscosity of many non-Newtonian fluids varies with shear rate.\n\nFour classes of non-Newtonian fluids depend on how the fluid viscosity—a measure of a fluid’s ability to resist flow—varies in response to the duration and magnitude of applied shear rate. The viscosity of\n\nthixotropic fluids decreases over time under shearing. For example, solid honey becomes a liquid after continuous stirring.\nrheopectic fluids increases over time under shearing. For example, cream will thicken after continuous stirring.\npseudoplastic fluids decreases with increasing shear rate; these fluids exhibit shear thinning behavior. For example, ketchup will squirt through a hole in a bottle top at high velocity but stand still as a dollop on a plate.\ndilatant fluids increases with increasing shear rate; these fluids exhibit shear thickening behavior.\n\nMost successful drilling fluids are non-Newtonian and exhibit behaviors that are described by rheological mathematical models of shear stress, or resistance, as a function of shear rate. In the Bingham plastic model, flow will not begin until the shear stress attains a minimum value, the yield stress, after which the flow is similar to that of a Newtonian fluid because the viscosity is constant and does not vary with shear rate.\nPseudoplasticity, or shear thinning, is a non-Newtonian behavior that is desirable for drilling fluids. Power-law and Herschel-Bulkley models describe pseudoplastic behavior, in which the slope—the viscosity—of the shear stress versus shear rate curve decreases as the shear rate decreases.\n\nSee:\nBingham plastic model, Brookfield viscometer, direct-indicating viscometer, guar gum, Herschel–Bulkley fluid, Newtonian fluid, plastic fluid, power-law fluid, pseudoplastic, rheology, shear rate, shear stress, viscosity, XC polymer",

In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement.\n\nCompared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution.

The liquid (oil, emulsion) leaves the vessel at the bottom through a level-control or dump valve. The gas leaves the vessel at the top, passing through a mist extractor to remove the small liquid droplets in the gas.\nSeparators can be categorized according to their operating pressure. Low-pressure units handle pressures of 10 to 180 psi [69 to 1, 241 kPa]. Medium-pressure separators operate from 230 to 700 psi [1, 586 to 4, 826 kPa]. High-pressure units handle pressures of 975 to 1, 500 psi [6, 722 to 10, 342 kPa].\nGravity segregation is the main force that accomplishes the separation, which means the heaviest fluid settles to the bottom and the lightest fluid rises to the top. Additionally, inside the vessel, the degree of separation between gas and liquid will depend on the separator operating pressure, the residence time of the fluid mixture and the type of flow of the fluid.

Since most measurements of oil and gas production are made at the surface, and since the fluid flow takes place in the formation, volume factors are needed to convert measured surface volumes to reservoir conditions.

An oil-mud emulsifier lowers the interfacial tension between oil and water, which allows stable emulsions with small drops to be formed. Historically, oil-mud emulsifiers have been classified as primary and secondary. Secondary emulsifiers are generally not used alone to make a stable oil mud. Emulsifiers can be calcium fatty-acid soaps made from various fatty acids and lime, or derivatives such as amides, amines, amidoamines and imidazolines made by reactions of fatty acids and various ethanolamine compounds. These emulsifiers surround water droplets, like an encapsulating film, with the fatty acid component extending into the oil phase. Emulsifier molecules that cannot fit around drops form clusters (micelles) in the oil phase or adsorb onto solids. Oil-mud emulsion drops each behave like a small osmotic cell. The emulsifier around the drops acts like a semipermeable membrane through which water can move but ions cannot pass. Thus, oil muds have the special capability (which water muds do not have) to control water transfer to and from the drops simply by adjusting salinity within the water phase of the oil mud.\n\nSee:\nbalanced-activity oil mud, colloid, emulsion, fatty acid, fatty-acid soap, HLB number, hydrophile-lipophile balance number, interfacial tension, invert-emulsion oil mud, low-colloid oil mud, oil mud, osmosis, soap, water-in-oil emulsion",

The weight percent of an oxide can be calculated from the dry weight percent of the cation by knowing the chemical formula (for example, SiO2 from Si).\n\nThe absolute dry weight percent, W, of element i is given by Wi = F * Yi / Si where F is the unknown normalization factor, Yi is the measured spectral gamma ray yield and Si is the tool sensitivity to that element, measured in the laboratory.

  "oxygen activation": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA phenomenon exploited for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the flow of water in or around a borehole based on oxygen activation. Oxygen (16O) can be activated by high-energy neutrons to produce an isotope of nitrogen (16N), which decays back to oxygen with a half-life of 7.1 seconds and emits an easily detected gamma ray of 6.13 MeV. The neutrons are supplied by the generator of a pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tool. The gamma rays are counted in detectors placed above the tool, for upward flow, or below it for downward flow.\n\nVarious techniques have been developed to analyze the count rates in terms of water velocity, flow rate and distance from tool. The earliest methods were based of the ratio of the counts from two detectors. Stationary oxygen and other background signals are eliminated by calibration in a known zone of zero flow, by counting only in a window near 6.13 MeV, or by optimizing the detector spacings. More recently, impulse-activation techniques have been introduced.

Pickett. The plot is based on taking the logarithm of the Archie equation. Points of constant water saturation (Sw) will plot on a straight line with negative slope of value m. Water zones define the lowermost line on the plot. Since Sw = 1, the water resistivity can be determined from a point on the line. Once the water line is established, other parallel lines can be drawn for different Sw, assuming a constant n (usually 2). Other data can then be plotted and interpreted in terms of Sw. The same technique can be applied to the flushed zone, using flushed-zone measurements.\n\nReference: Pickett GR: \"A Review of Current Techniques for Determination of Water Saturation from Logs, \" paper SPE 1446, presented at the SPE Rocky Mountain Regional Meeting, Denver, Colorado, USA, May 23-24, 1966; SPE Journal of Petroleum Technology (November 1966): 1425-1435.\n\nSee:\nArchie equation, flushed zone, water saturation",

  "plate tectonics": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nThe unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.\n\nSynonyms:\ntectonics\n\nSee:\nactive margin, aulacogen, basin, core, craton, earthquake, eustasy, Global Positioning System, isostasy, midoceanic ridge, normal fault, orogeny, passive margin, preservation, rift, rock, sedimentary basin, sequence stratigraphy, tectonism, transform fault, Wadati-Benioff zone",

Molecular size (weight) influences how a specific polymer type performs in a given type of mud. A small polymer may be a deflocculant, whereas a large polymer of the same type may be a flocculant. Some are viscosifiers and others are fluid-loss control additives while others are multifunctional.\n\nSee:\nacrylamide polymer, acrylate polymer, biopolymer, carboxymethyl hydroxyethylcellulose, clay extender, colloid, conventional mud, copolymer, deflocculant, flocculant, gunk plug, hydrolysis, hydroxyethylcellulose, lignin, lignite, monomer, PHPA mud, polar compound, polyelectrolyte, polyol, resin, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, vinyl polymer, wastewater cleanup, water clarification, XC polymer",

Viscosity is increased until the mobility of the injectant is less than that of the oil phase in place, so the mobility ratio is less than unity. This condition maximizes oil-recovery sweep efficiency, creating a smooth flood front without viscous fingering. Polymer flooding is also applied to heterogeneous reservoirs; the viscous injectant flows along high-permeability layers, decreasing the flow rates within them and enhancing sweep of zones with lower permeabilities.

Porosity can be generated by the development of fractures, in which case it is called fracture porosity. Effective porosity is the interconnected pore volume in a rock that contributes to fluid flow in a reservoir. It excludes isolated pores.

  "porosity exponent": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe exponent, m, in the relation of formation factor (F) to porosity (phi). For a single sample, F is related to phi using the Archie equation F = 1 / phim, with m being the only coefficient needed. In this case, m has been related to many physical parameters, but above all to the tortuosity of the pore space. In theory, it can range from 1 for a bundle of tubes to infinity for porosity that is completely unconnected. For a simple packing of equal spheres, m = 1.5. With a more tortuous pore space or more isolated pores, m increases, while with fractures or conductive solids, m decreases. As a general average for typical reservoir rocks, m is often taken as 2.\n\nFor a group of rock samples, it is common practice to find a relationship between F and phi that uses two coefficients (F = a / phim). In this case m, like a, becomes an empirical constant of best fit between F and phi, and may take a wide range of values. In complex formations, such as shaly sands or carbonates with multiple pore types, a constant m does not give good results. One solution is to vary m, with the variability related to parameters such as porosity, shaliness, or rock texture, or else determined directly from logs in zones where the water saturation is known or can be computed from a nonresistivity measurement such as electromagnetic propagation.\n\nIn shaly sands, the preferred solution is to use a saturation equation, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS or CRMM, in which m is defined as the intrinsic m, determined from the intrinsic formation factor at high salinities or after correction for the effect of shale. In carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, one solution is to use equations with different porosity exponents for each pore type.

  "potassium ion": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nThe ion of potassium, K+. There are tests used to monitor high (>5, 000 mg/L) or low (<5, 000 mg/L) potassium ion concentration in water-based muds. The test for high\nconcentration, as specified by the API, is based on the insolubility of potassium perchlorate. A volume of mud filtrate is mixed with an excess of NaClO4 in a centrifuge tube. White KClO4 is precipitated by the reaction. After the\ntube has spun in a centrifuge to settle the white sediment in the tube, the amount of precipitate is read and compared to a calibration chart that relates sediment to concentration of K+ in the filtrate sample. The test to monitor low\npotassium ion concentration in water-base muds, as prescribed by API, is a titration procedure using quaternary ammonium salt solution (QAS) as reagent. Potassium ion is first precipitated as the tetraphenylborate (TPB) salt by adding an\nexcess of sodium tetraphenylborate. After filtering out the solid, the amount of TPB not reacted with K+ ion is titrated with a standard QAS solution. The endpoint is purple-to-light blue color change.\nThe test for high potassium ion\nconcentration was first applied to drilling fluids by Ron Steiger at Exxon and has proven to be a reliable way to measure K+ ion concentration in a mud at the wellsite, which allows the mud engineer to maintain the\nproper level when drilling through hydratable shales. Before a direct test for K+ ion was available, KCl in a mud was monitored by chloride analysis. Although simple to perform, this analysis was misleading and counterproductive because after\ndrilling shale with a new KCl mud for awhile, the beneficial K+ ion was consumed by the clays but the Cl- ion remained in the mud. Eventually, the wellbore shales hydrated, fell into the hole and created severe mud and drilling\nproblems. As a result of improper analytical methods, early potassium muds earned an undeservedly negative reputation.\nFor optimal shale stability, K+ ion must be continually maintained by adding KCl (or some other K salt) as fast as it\nis consumed. The advent of a direct field-worthy method for K+ analysis, the result of Dr. Steiger's efforts, was a breakthrough in the use of water mud for drilling troublesome shale.\n\nReference: Steiger RP: \"Fundamentals and Use\nof Potassium/Polymer Drilling Fluids to Minimize Drilling and Completion Problems Associated with Hydratable Clays, \" Journal of Petroleum Technology 34, no. 8 (August 1982): 1661-1670.\n\nSee:\nanion, cation, chloride test, clay, filtrate, potassium mud, shale",
  "potassium mud": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA class of muds that contain potassium ion (K+) dissolved in the water phase. Potassium muds are the most widely accepted water mud system for drilling water-sensitive shales, especially hard, brittle shales. K+ ions attach to clay surfaces and lend stability to shale exposed to drilling fluids by the bit. The ions also help hold the cuttings together, minimizing dispersion into finer particles. The presence of Na+ ions counteracts the benefits of K+ ions and should be minimized by using fresh water (not sea water) for make-up water. With time, Na+, Ca+2 and other ions accumulate from ion exchange with clays, making the mud less effective, but regular treatment to remove Ca+2 improves polymer function. Potassium chloride, KCl, is the most widely used potassium source. Others are potassium acetate, potassium carbonate, potassium lignite, potassium hydroxide and potassium salt of PHPA. Use of bentonite clay is restricted because of its strong affinity for K+. Instead, various polymers are used. XC polymer and PHPA are used for rheology. For fluid-loss control, mixtures of starch and polyanionic cellulose are often used. CM starch, HP starch, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium polyacrylate (SPA) are also used. PHPA is widely used for shale encapsulation. Potassium, lime and starch-like polymers have also been used as potassium mud systems. Although three API methods exist for determining the K+ ion concentration, the centrifuge method (for K+ >5000 mg/L) is the most accepted field method, and essential for daily monitoring of potassium in a mud. Regular additions of potassium salt maintain shale stability. K+ ion is rapidly consumed while drilling shallow, soft and highly dispersive (gumbo) shales, but maintaining sufficient K+ ion to stabilize gumbo can become expensive when drilling large holes. Researchers, notably Dr. Dennis O'Brien and Dr. Martin Chenevert (while at Exxon Production Research), evaluated different shales, their clay mineralogy and the concentration of K+ needed to stabilize them. Potassium muds above about 1 wt.% K+ ion usually fail the mysid shrimp (US EPA) bioassay test. Therefore, K-muds currently find low acceptance in offshore drilling in USA waters.\n\nReference: O'Brien DE and Chenevert ME: \"Stabilizing Sensitive Shales with Inhibited Potassium-Based Drilling Fluids, \" Journal of Petroleum Technology 25, no. 9 (September 1973): 1089-1100.\n\nSee:\nacrylamide acrylate polymer, carboxymethyl starch, caustic potash, clay-water interaction, encapsulation, EPA, inhibit, inhibitive mud, lime mud, PHPA mud, polyanionic cellulose, potassium ion, SPA, starch, water-based drilling fluid",

[Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA reaction by-product. In sandstone acidizing, the reaction between hydrofluoric acids [HF] or spent HF acids with formation minerals can precipitate nondamaging products, such as silica, borosilicates or fluoborates. However, other insoluble or difficult to remove by-products can create formation damage.\n\nFerric iron (Fe+3) and ferrous iron (Fe+2) are potential sources for precipitates. Ferric iron present in some formation minerals, including chlorite and glauconite clays, and in tubing rust (iron oxide) can precipitate as ferric hydroxide [Fe(OH)3], which is a gelatinous, highly insoluble mass that can plug pore channels and reduce permeability. The precipitation of ferric hydroxide or ferrous hydroxide [Fe(OH)2] depends on the pH of the spent acid. The former needs a pH higher than 2.2, while the latter requires a pH higher than 7.7. Since the maximum pH for a spent acid is approximately 5.3, the precipitation of ferric hydroxide is more common. Iron-sequestering or iron-reducing agents can be used in acid to maintain the ferric iron in solution.\n\nCalcium fluoride [CaF2] precipitates when HF contacts calcite or any other calcium source, and alkali-fluosilicates or iron sulfide form crystal-like by-products that can bridge pore throats. Additionally, some sequestering agents, corrosion inhibitors or friction reducers can also form residues that may plug formation pores.\n\nThe formation of precipitates can be avoided or reduced by using a preflush, which dissolves calcareous material, iron rust or iron scales, and displaces formation brines (K, Na, Ca ions) away from the wellbore, thereby reducing the formation of CaF2, ferric hydroxide and alkali-fluosilicates.",

  "pressure hunt": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe evaluation of various well parameters in an attempt to identify when the pore pressure in a drilling well is changing. A team consisting of geologists, engineers and most of the rigsite personnel usually conducts the hunt. The purpose of a pressure hunt is to detect the pore pressure transition (usually from lower to higher pressure) and safely set casing in the transition zone to maximize wellbore strength. A casing string set too shallow, while eliminating some problems associated with drilling fluid contacting the wellbore wall, may not add strength or aid in drilling deeper, perhaps abnormally pressured formations. On the other hand, if drilling is continued too deep into a transition zone, a kick may be taken that cannot be contained in the open wellbore, causing an underground blowout. The hunt team, therefore, seeks to get into the transition zone far enough to gain wellbore strength without taking a kick.\n\nSee:\nblowout, casing, casing point, casing string, kick, pore pressure",
  "pressure integrity test": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAlso known as leakoff test, a test to determine the strength or fracture pressure of the open formation, usually conducted immediately after drilling below a new casing shoe. During the test, the well is shut in and fluid is pumped into the wellbore to gradually increase the pressure that the formation experiences. At some pressure, fluid will enter the formation, or leak off, either moving through permeable paths in the rock or by creating a space by fracturing the rock. The results of the leakoff test dictate the maximum pressure or mud weight that may be applied to the well during drilling operations.

For the same nominal depth of investigation, the attenuation resistivity reads deeper than the phase-shift resistivity and is less affected by invasion, but more affected by surrounding beds and apparent dip. The attenuation measurement has a poorer vertical resolution and is less affected by anisotropy.

The basic measurement is accomplished using a transmitter and two receivers. At these frequencies, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus, the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the phase shift and the attenuation resistivity. In practice, multiple transmitters may be used to obtain different depths of investigation and achieve borehole compensation.

In a typical tool, a microwave transmitter is placed a few inches below two receivers separated by 4 cm [1.6 in.]. At this frequency, the response is best explained as the propagation of a wave. Thus the phase shift and attenuation of the wave between the receivers are measured and transformed to give the log measurements of propagation time and attenuation. Because of the short spacings, the measurement has excellent vertical resolution and reads within inches of the borehole wall except at high resistivity. Different transmitter and receiver spacings and orientations are used, leading to different arrays, such as the endfire array and the broadside array.\n\nAn ideal measurement would give the plane wave properties of the formation. However, the geometry of the measurement precludes this, so that a correction, known as the spreading-loss correction, is needed for the attenuation and to a much smaller extent for the propagation time. The measurement is also affected by the dielectric properties and thickness of the mudcake.

Justification for drilling a prospect is made by assembling evidence for an active petroleum system, or reasonable probability of encountering reservoir-quality rock, a trap of sufficient size, adequate sealing rock, and appropriate conditions for generation and migration of hydrocarbons to fill the trap. A single drilling location is also called a prospect, but the term is more properly used in the context of exploration.

The proximity log measures the resistivity of the flushed zone with minimum influence from the mudcake or the undisturbed zone. The central current-emitting electrode (A0) is surrounded by a guard electrode that emits sufficient current to focus the current from A0 a certain distance into the formation. The electrodes are mounted on a pad that is pressed against the borehole wall. In a typical tool design, 90% of the signal comes from within 5 to 10 in. [13 to 25 cm] of the pad. This is deeper than the microlaterolog, which ensures that the mudcake has less effect but means that the proximity log is more often affected by the undisturbed zone.\n\nSee:\nelectrode resistivity, flushed zone, microresistivity, undisturbed zone",
  "pseudogeometrical factor": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance.\n\nThe pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as:\n\n\n\nJx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut)\n\n\n\nwhere Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut.\n\nPseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).\n\nSee:\ndepth of investigation, radial resolution, resistivity log, vertical resolution",
  "quick lime": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA chemical with formula CaO, commonly called quick lime or hot lime. When hydrated with one mole of water, it forms slaked lime, Ca(OH)2.

Radial responses are determined by computer simulation or laboratory measurement. For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the radial response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the radial response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted radial responses have been determined in formations that are vertically homogeneous and have small radial changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor. These factors are appropriate for volumetric measurements such as nuclear and resistivity measurements, but not for others such as acoustic propagation.\n\nSee:\ndepth of investigation, radial resolution, vertical response",

Radio silence is required for wireline operations when using a non-radio-safe detonator. It is typically imposed when rigging up perforating guns and until the guns have been run in the hole to 200 ft [61 m] below ground level or mud line. Radio silence is imposed again when retrieving the gun system as it passes the 200-ft mark. Radio silence must be maintained until it has been confirmed that all charges have been shot. This practice is not required when radio-safe detonators are used, but is common practice at many wellsites.",

When the radioactive solution is released into an injected fluid, the movement of the mixture can be traced by gamma ray detectors located in the tool.\n\nRadioactive tracers are generally used in injection wells rather than in production wells to avoid radioactive contamination at the surface. The main applications of radioactive tracers include establishing flow profiles in injection wells, detecting fluid movements behind the pipe, and locating leaking packers and fluid movement between wells.\n\nSee:\ninjection well",
  "radioactive-tracer log": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA record of the presence of tracer material placed in or around the borehole to measure fluid movement in injection wells. There are two traditional techniques for recording radioactive-tracer logs: the tracer-loss measurement, in which a tracer material is added to the completion fluid and its progress monitored with a gamma ray tool; and the velocity-shot measurement, in which the tracer is ejected from one part of a production logging tool and its progress monitored by one or more gamma ray detectors farther down the tool.\n\nRadioactive-tracer logs are used to determine injection-flow profiles and detect channels or leaks. They may also be used in production wells, but care must be taken to isolate the fluids on surface until the tracer has decayed to safe levels. The tracer is a radioactive isotope that is soluble in water, oil or gas, or else insoluble, as in the bead tracer. Different radioactive elements with distinct energies and lifetimes may be used. Today, for water injection, the most common is a water-soluble iodine tracer that has a half-life of 8.1 days, while for steam injection a gas with krypton is used.\n\nSee:\nmultiple-isotope log, production log, timed slug analysis, tracer measurement",

Most quoted depths of investigation assume a homogeneous formation with certain properties, such as a given resistivity or fluid content.

  "ram blowout preventer": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA device that can be used to quickly seal the top of the well in the event of a well control event (kick). A ram blowout preventer (BOP) consists of two halves of a cover for the well that are split down the middle. Large-diameter hydraulic cylinders, normally retracted, force the two halves of the cover together in the middle to seal the wellbore. These covers are constructed of steel for strength and fitted with elastomer components on the sealing surfaces. The halves of the covers, formally called ram blocks, are available in a variety of configurations. In some designs, they are flat at the mating surfaces to enable them to seal over an open wellbore. Other designs have a circular cutout in the middle that corresponds to the diameter of the pipe in the hole to seal the well when pipe is in the hole. These pipe rams effectively seal a limited range of pipe diameters. Variable-bore rams are designed to seal a wider range of pipe diameters, albeit at a sacrifice of other design criteria, notably element life and hang-off weight. Still other ram blocks are fitted with a tool steel-cutting surface to enable the ram BOPs to completely shear through drillpipe, hang the drillstring off on the ram blocks themselves and seal the wellbore. Obviously, such an action limits future options and is employed only as a last resort to regain pressure control of the wellbore.

  "rate of shear": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nThe velocity gradient measured across the diameter of a fluid-flow channel, be it a pipe, annulus or other shape. Shear rate is the rate of change of velocity at which one layer of fluid passes over an adjacent layer. As an example, consider that a fluid is placed between two parallel plates that are 1.0 cm apart, the upper plate moving at a velocity of 1.0 cm/sec and the lower plate fixed. The fluid layer at the lower plate is not moving and the layer nearest the top plate is moving at 1.0 cm/sec. Halfway between the plate, a layer is moving at 0.5 cm/sec. The velocity gradient is the rate of change of velocity with distance from the plates. This simple case shows the uniform velocity gradient with shear rate (v1 - v2)/h = shear rate = (cm/sec)/(cm/1) = 1/sec.

Non-Darcy flow is typically observed in high-rate gas wells when the flow converging to the wellbore reaches flow velocities exceeding the Reynolds number for laminar or Darcy flow, and results in turbulent flow.

  "reservoir characterization model": "1. n. [Shale Gas]\n\nA model of a specific volume of the subsurface that incorporates all the geologic characteristics of the reservoir. Such models are used to quantify characteristics within the subsurface volume that are relatively stable over long periods of time and can, therefore, be considered static. These attributes include the structural shape and thicknesses of the formations within the subsurface volume being modeled, their lithologies, and the porosity and permeability distributions. These last two characteristics often vary significantly from location to location within the volume, resulting in heterogeneity. However, porosity and permeability are stable in the near-geologic timeframe and do not change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. The result of reservoir characterization is a reservoir characterization model (also known as a static model and sometimes referred to as a geologic model).\n\nShale gas reservoir rocks require the analysis of high-quality seismic data, core, and log measurements and engineering data to produce an accurate reservoir characterization model. This model is then used as input into reservoir simulation, during which reservoir engineers add other reservoir characteristics, such as pressures, temperatures, and fluid and gas compositions. These features can change due to the movement of fluids or gases through any of the formations pore spaces. Since these are dynamic in their nature over short timeframes, once production is initiated these models are referred to as dynamic models. Thorough reservoir simulations (dynamic models) that are based on accurately developed reservoir characterizations (static models) can be of significant value in optimizing well placement and field-development planning.",

  "retort method": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA technique for measuring the fluid saturations in a core sample by heating the sample and measuring the volumes of water and oil driven off. The sample is crushed and weighed before being placed in the retort. It is then heated in stages or directly to 650oC [1200oF] during which the fluids are vaporized, collected, condensed and separated. Plateaus in the rise of the cumulative water volume with temperature are sometimes analyzed to indicate when free water, surface clay-bound water and interlayer clay-bound water have been driven off.\nThe volumes of water and oil are measured directly, but corrections are needed to account for alterations in the oil. The volume of gas also is needed for accurate results. This is measured on a separate, adjacent sample by injecting mercury under pressure and measuring the volume absorbed. Before injection, the sample is weighed and its bulk volume determined by mercury displacement. The total pore volume is then the sum of the volumes of gas, oil and water.

  "roller cone bit": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA tool designed to crush rock efficiently while incurring a minimal amount of wear on the cutting surfaces. Invented by Howard Hughes, the roller-cone bit has conical cutters or cones that have spiked teeth around them. As the drillstring is rotated, the bit cones roll along the bottom of the hole in a circle. As they roll, new teeth come in contact with the bottom of the hole, crushing the rock immediately below and around the bit tooth. As the cone rolls, the tooth then lifts off the bottom of the hole and a high-velocity fluid jet strikes the crushed rock chips to remove them from the bottom of the hole and up the annulus. As this occurs, another tooth makes contact with the bottom of the hole and creates new rock chips. Thus, the process of chipping the rock and removing the small rock chips with the fluid jets is continuous. The teeth intermesh on the cones, which helps clean the cones and enables larger teeth to be used. There are two main types of roller-cone bits, steel milled-tooth bits and carbide insert bits.\n\n\n\nAlternate Form:\nroller cone bit",
  "roller stem": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA downhole tool used on slickline operations conducted on a deviated wellbore to provide additional mass to the tool string.

Fraction of pore volume occupied by oil at any location in a reservoir at any time during its life. Remaining oil saturation has no petrophysical significance beyond an assessment of the amount of oil remaining in the rock. Considered a snapshot of the reservoir, this assessment depends on the location in the reservoir and time of the measurement.

The kelly bushing has an inside diameter profile that matches that of the kelly, usually square or hexagonal. It is connected to the rotary table by four large steel pins that fit into mating holes in the rotary table. The rotary motion from the rotary table is transmitted to the bushing through the pins, and then to the kelly itself through the square or hexagonal flat surfaces between the kelly and the kelly bushing. The kelly then turns the entire drillstring because it is screwed into the top of the drillstring itself. Depth measurements are commonly referenced to the KB, such as 8327 ft KB, meaning 8327 feet below the kelly bushing.\n\nSynonyms:\nKB, kelly bushing\n\nSee:\nkelly, rotary table",

This method, made popular after the discovery of the East Texas Field by \"Dad\" Joiner in 1930, is much more efficient than the alternative, cable tool drilling. Rotary drilling is a nearly continuous process, because cuttings are removed as drilling fluids circulate through the bit and up the wellbore to the surface. Cable tool operations are discontinuous and cuttings removal is inefficient. This difference in efficiency becomes particularly significant as hole depth increases.\n\nSee:\ncable-tool drilling, cuttings, directional drilling, settling pit, steerable motor",
  "rotary hose": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA large-diameter (3- to 5-in inside diameter), high-pressure flexible line used to connect the standpipe to the swivel.

  "rotary table": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe revolving or spinning section of the drillfloor that provides power to turn the drillstring in a clockwise direction (as viewed from above). The rotary motion and power are transmitted through the kelly bushing and the kelly to the drillstring. When the drillstring is rotating, the drilling crew commonly describes the operation as simply, \"rotating to the right, \" \"turning to the right, \" or, \"rotating on bottom.\" Almost all rigs today have a rotary table, either as primary or backup system for rotating the drillstring. Topdrive technology, which allows continuous rotation of the drillstring, has replaced the rotary table in certain operations.

  "round trip": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nThe complete operation of removing the drillstring from the wellbore and running it back in the hole. This operation is typically undertaken when the bit becomes dull or broken, and no longer drills the rock efficiently. After some preliminary preparations for the trip, the rig crew removes the drillstring 90 ft [27 m] at a time, by unscrewing every third drillpipe or drill collar connection. When the three joints are unscrewed from the rest of the drillstring, they are carefully stored upright in the derrick by the fingerboards at the top and careful placement on wooden planks on the rig floor. After the drillstring has been removed from the wellbore, the dull bit is unscrewed with the use of a bit breaker and quickly examined to determine why the bit dulled or failed. Depending on the failure mechanism, the crew might choose a different type of bit for the next section. If the bearings on the prior bit failed, but the cutting structures are still sharp and intact, the crew may opt for a faster drilling (less durable) cutting structure. Conversely, if the bit teeth are worn out but the bearings are still sealed and functioning, the crew should choose a bit with more durable (and less aggressive) cutting structures. Once the bit is chosen, it is screwed onto the bottom of the drill collars with the help of the bit breaker, the drill collars are run into the hole (RIH), and the drillpipe is run in the hole. Once on bottom, drilling commences again. The duration of this operation depends on the total depth of the well and the skill of the rig crew. A general estimate for a competent crew is that the round trip requires one hour per thousand feet of hole, plus an hour or two for handling collars and bits. At that rate, a round trip in a ten thousand-foot well might take twelve hours. A round trip for a 30, 000-ft [9230 m] well might take 32 or more hours, especially if intermediate hole-cleaning operations must be undertaken.\n\nAlternate Form:\ntrip\n\nSee:\nbit breaker, break circulation, derrick, derrickman, fingerboard, run in hole, tripping pipe, wiper trip",

  "salt": "1. n. [Geology]\n\n[NaCl]\n\nA soft, soluble evaporite mineral also known as halite or rock salt. Because salt is less dense than many sedimentary rocks, it is relatively buoyant and can form salt domes, pillars or curtains by flowing and breaking through or piercing overlying sediments, as seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Zagros fold belt. Halite can be critical in forming hydrocarbon traps and seals because it tends to flow rather than fracture during deformation, thus preventing hydrocarbons from leaking out of a trap even during and after some types of deformation.\n\nSynonyms:\nhalite\n\nSee:\ncaprock, diapir, gypsum, rheology, salt dome, seal, subsalt\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

The source is typically placed directly above the top of a salt dome and the receivers are placed at a number of locations within the borehole. This technique takes advantage of the fact that sound travels faster through the salt than the surrounding soft sediments, such as in the US Gulf Coast. This survey measures the fastest travel path, with part of its path through the salt.

Starch and starch derivatives for fluid-loss control and xanthan gums for hole-cleaning are among the few highly effective additives for saltwater muds. Attapulgite and sepiolite are used in saltwater muds only for cuttings lifting. The primary use of saltwater mud is to drill salt strata that are prone to dissolution when exposed to other types of drilling fluid. A saturated salt mud is used to drill salt to prevent hole enlargement. In hot, plastic, salt zones, the hole may close inward unless extremely high mud weight is maintained. As an alternative to high mud weight, maintaining undersaturation in the fluid allows controlled leaching to offset hole closure by plastic flow. Sized salt particles in saturated saltwater muds are used, along with polymers, to bridge over permeable production zones. The salt can be removed later with a water flush. Salt solids can increase density beyond 10 lbm/gal, up to about 13 lbm/gal, if needed.\n\nSynonyms:\nHE starch\n\nSee:\ncarrying capacity, chloride test, drilling fluid, hydroxypropyl starch, saltwater flow, sized salt, starch, undersaturated fluid, water-based drilling fluid, XC polymer",

Practical equations are all extensions of the Archie equation, which is valid for a rock with very little clay, or very high salinity water, and with a regular pore structure. The majority deal with the problem of shaly sands, and can be divided into two main groups?those that treat the shale as a volume of conductive material (Vsh models), and those that analyze the effect of clay counter-ions. Vsh models take many forms. Typical examples are the Simandoux, laminated sand and Indonesian equations. The other group includes the Waxman-Smits, Dual Water and SGS equations. Most nonshaly sand equations deal with the problem of mixed pore types, for example combinations of fractures, isolated pores and intergranular pores.\n\nSee:\nisolated porosity",
  "saturation exponent": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe exponent, n, in the relation of water saturation, Sw, to resistivity index, I (I = Sw-n) for a sample of rock. It expresses the effect on the resistivity of desaturating the sample, or replacing water with a non-conductive fluid. In petrophysically simple, water-wet rocks (Archie rocks), n is constant for different values of Sw, and a single average n can be found for a particular reservoir or formation. A typical value is 2. In more complex rocks, n changes with Sw, although often being about 2 near Sw = 1. In rocks with conductive minerals, such as shaly sands, n becomes increasingly lower as Sw is reduced. This change is negligible for high-salinity waters, but increases as the salinity is reduced. In shaly-sand saturation equations, such as Waxman-Smits, dual water, SGS and CRMM, n is the intrinsic n, determined with high-salinity water or with the clay effects removed. The variation of I with Sw is then predicted, with varying success, by the different equations.\nIn carbonates with multiple pore types, such as fractures, vugs, interparticle porosity and microporosity, n may change as each pore type is desaturated. A different n may be used for a different range of Sw. In all cases, n increases if any pores are oil-wet. Values up to 8 have been reported in very oil-wet rocks.",
  "saturation unit": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA unit equal to the percentage of a given fluid in the total volume of a pore space. The term is abbreviated to s.u. and lies between 0 and 100.\n\nSee:\nflushed-zone water saturation, water saturation",
  "saver sub": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA short length of drill collar that has male threads on one end and female on the other. It is screwed onto the bottom of the kelly or topdrive and onto the rest of the drillstring. When the hole must be deepened, and pipe added to the drillstring, the threads are unscrewed between the saver sub and the rest of the drillstring, as opposed to between the kelly or topdrive and the saver sub. This means that the connection between the kelly or topdrive and the saver sub rarely is used, and suffers minimal wear and tear, whereas the lower connection is used in almost all cases and suffers the most wear and tear. The saver sub is expendable and does not represent a major investment. However, the kelly or topdrive component threads are spared by use of a saver sub, and those components represent a significant capital cost and considerable downtime when replaced.\n\nSee:\ndrill collar, kelly, slips, top drive",

[Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA mineral deposit that can occur in the tubing, the gravel pack, the perforations or the formation. Scale deposition occurs when the solution equilibrium of the water is disturbed by pressure and temperature changes, dissolved gases or incompatibility between mixing waters. Scale deposits are the most common and most troublesome damage problems in the oil field and can occur in both production and injection wells.\n\nAll waters used in well operations can be potential sources of scale, including water used in waterflood operations and filtrate from completion, workover or treating fluids. Therefore, reduction of scale deposition is directly related to reduction of bad water production.\n\nSee:\nacid wash, scale removal, water control",
  "scale inhibitor": "1. n. [Well Completions]\n\nA chemical treatment used to control or prevent scale deposition in the production conduit or completion system. Scale-inhibitor chemicals may be continuously injected through a downhole injection point in the completion, or periodic squeeze treatments may be undertaken to place the inhibitor in the reservoir matrix for subsequent commingling with produced fluids.\nSome scale-inhibitor systems integrate scale inhibitors and fracture treatments into one step, which guarantees that the entire well is treated with scale inhibitor. In this type of treatment, a high-efficiency scale inhibitor is pumped into the matrix surrounding the fracture face during leakoff. It adsorbs to the matrix during pumping until the fracture begins to produce water. As water passes through the inhibitor-adsorbed zone, it dissolves sufficient inhibitor to prevent scale deposition. The inhibitor is better placed than in a conventional scale-inhibitor squeeze, which reduces the retreatment cost and improves production.\nLearn more about our scale inhibitor offerings.\n\nSee:\nscale removal",
  "scale inhibitor squeeze": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA type of inhibition treatment used to control or prevent scale deposition. In a scale-inhibitor squeeze, the inhibitor is pumped into a water-producing zone.

Sulfide corrosion of ferrous alloys and chloride corrosion of stainless steels are two common type of SCC. When high-strength steel remains in contact with hydrogen sulfide (or sulfide ion) in a water-mud environment, sulfide SCC may occur. Tool joints, hardened parts of blowout preventers and valve trim are particularly susceptible to brittle failure caused by sulfide SCC. For this reason, along with toxicity risks of hydrogen sulfide gas, it is essential that water muds be kept entirely free of soluble sulfides and especially hydrogen sulfide at low pH.\n\nAlternate Form:\nstress corrosion cracking",

In the crystal, an incident gamma ray imparts energy to electrons through Compton scattering, photoelectric absorption and pair production. The electrons excite the detector crystal lattice. Crystal de-excitation emits visible or near-visible light, the scintillation, which is detected by the photomultiplier and transformed into an electrical pulse. The frequency and amplitude of the electric pulse are related to the number of gamma rays and their respective energy levels, and are recorded in a log.

The scratcher is a simple device, consisting of a band of steel that fits around a joint of casing, and stiff wire fingers or cable loops sticking out in all directions around the band (360-degree coverage). A scratcher resembles a bottlebrush, but its diameter is greater than its height. Importantly, for scratchers to be effective, the casing must be moved. This movement may be reciprocal motion in and out of the wellbore, rotary motion, or both. In general, the more motion, the better the cement job will be.\n\nSee:\ncasing, cementing",

  "secondary porosity index": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nAn indicator of the porosity that does not contribute to a sonic measurement of interval transit time. The transit time is little affected by vugs, fractures and other irregular events because the sonic wave finds a faster path around them. Spherical pores such as oomolds also have less effect on traveltime than oblate pores. Thus, when the sonic porosity is less than some measurement of the total porosity, the difference can be attributed to the presence of post-depositional, or secondary, porosity. The sonic porosity is usually derived from the Wyllie time-average equation, or some other suitable transform, and the total porosity taken as the density-neutron crossplot porosity.\n\nSee:\nsonic log",
  "secondary production": "1. n.

  "secondary recovery": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery, Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nThe second stage of hydrocarbon production during which an external fluid such as water or gas is injected into the reservoir through injection wells located in rock that has fluid communication with production wells. The purpose of secondary recovery is to maintain reservoir pressure and to displace hydrocarbons toward the wellbore.\n\nThe most common secondary recovery techniques are gas injection and waterflooding. Normally, gas is injected into the gas cap and water is injected into the production zone to sweep oil from the reservoir. A pressure-maintenance program can begin during the primary recovery stage, but it is a form or enhanced recovery.\n\nThe secondary recovery stage reaches its limit when the injected fluid (water or gas) is produced in considerable amounts from the production wells and the production is no longer economical. The successive use of primary recovery and secondary recovery in an oil reservoir produces about 15% to 40% of the original oil in place.\n\nSee:\nenhanced oil recovery, gas cap, improved oil recovery, primary recovery, reservoir pressure, tertiary recovery, waterdrive, waterflooding",

  "sedimentary": "1. adj. [Geology]\n\nOne of the three main classes of rock (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary). Sedimentary rocks are formed at the Earth's surface through deposition of sediments derived from weathered rocks, biogenic activity or precipitation from solution. Clastic sedimentary rocks such as conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones and shales form as older rocks weather and erode, and their particles accumulate and lithify, or harden, as they are compacted and cemented. Biogenic sedimentary rocks form as a result of activity by organisms, including coral reefs that become limestone. Precipitates, such as the evaporite minerals halite (salt) and gypsum can form vast thicknesses of rock as seawater evaporates. Sedimentary rocks can include a wide variety of minerals, but quartz, feldspar, calcite, dolomite and evaporite group and clay group minerals are most common because of their greater stability at the Earth's surface than many minerals that comprise igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks, unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, can contain fossils because they form at temperatures and pressures that do not obliterate fossil remnants.\n\nSee:\nacoustic basement, carbonate, cement, cementation, chert, chlorite, clastic sediment, clay, clean, coal, compaction, condensed section, craton, depositional environment, diagenesis, diatom, dike, dolomite, evaporite, feldspar, gypsum, halite, hard rock, lamination, lithification, matrix, petrography, platform, quartz, reef, reservoir, rhombohedral packing, siliciclastic sediment, soft rock, stratigraphic trap, stratum, uniformitarianism",

A source, such as a vibrator unit, dynamite shot, or an air gun, generates acoustic or elastic vibrations that travel into the Earth, pass through strata with different seismic responses and filtering effects, and return to the surface to be recorded as seismic data. Optimal acquisition varies according to local conditions and involves employing the appropriate source (both type and intensity), optimal configuration of receivers, and orientation of receiver lines with respect to geological features. This ensures that the highest signal-to-noise ratio can be recorded, resolution is appropriate, and extraneous effects such as air waves, ground roll, multiples and diffractions can be minimized or distinguished, and removed through processing.\n\nSynonyms:\nacquisition\n\nSee:\ncommon midpoint method, explosive seismic data, gather, geophone, hydrophone, shotpoint",

Generating a set of pseudologs from seismic data is the process known as seismic inversion, a type of indirect modeling. Models can be developed to address problems of structure and stratigraphy prior to acquisition of seismic data and during the interpretation of the data.

  "seismic stratigraphy": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nAnother term for sequence stratigraphy, a field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied.\n\nThe field originated during the 1960s with the study of the stratigraphy of the continental USA, where numerous unconformities could be correlated widely, and led to the proposal that major unconformities might mark synchronous global-scale events. Through sequence stratigraphy, widely-separated sediments that occur between correlatable unconformities could be compared with each other. Studies of outcrops and seismic lines bore out these concepts, which initially were called \"Seismic Stratigraphy\" and first published widely in 1977. Further study of seismic lines led to the interpretation of the geometry or architecture of seismic events as representing particular styles of sedimentation and depositional environments, and the integration of such interpretations with well log and core data. Because of the simultaneous, competitive nature of the research, numerous oil companies and academic groups use the terminology of sequence stratigraphy differently, and new terms are added continually.\n\nSee:\ncondensed section, hiatus, onlap, parasequence, sequence boundary, sequence stratigraphy, source rock, systems tract",

  "seismic velocity": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nThe rate at which a seismic wave travels through a medium, that is, distance divided by traveltime. Seismic velocity can be determined from vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. It can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data. For example, the stacking velocity derived from normal moveout measurements of common depth point gathers differs from the average velocity measured vertically from a check-shot or vertical seismic profile (VSP). Velocity would be the same only in a constant-velocity (homogeneous) medium.\n\nSee:\nvelocity, velocity survey, wavelength",

Interpretation of the structure and composition of the Earth from artificially created seismic waves is a chief concern of seismologists exploring for hydrocarbons and other resources. English physicist John Mitchell (1724 to 1793) is known as the founder of seismology in part because of his observation that one can determine an earthquake's epicenter, or point of origin in the subsurface, by measuring the arrival time of earthquake waves at different locations. The invention of the modern seismograph in 1880 promoted further studies of earthquakes.\n\nSee:\nbirefringence, earthquake, elastic, reflection tomography, seismograph, shadow zone, wave",

The operating decks are elevated perhaps 100 or more feet above the pontoons on large steel columns. This design has the advantage of submerging most of the area of components in contact with the sea and minimizing loading from waves and wind. Semisubmersibles can operate in a wide range of water depths, including deep water. They are usually anchored with six to twelve anchors tethered by strong chains and wire cables, which are computer controlled to maintain stationkeeping. Semisubmersibles (called semisubs or simply semis) can be used for drilling, workover operations, and production platforms, depending on the equipment with which they are equipped.

[Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nIn matrix stimulation, a characteristic of rock that indicates the degree of reaction between the rock minerals and a given treating fluid. A formation is described as sensitive if a given stimulating fluid damages the formation. The detrimental reactions include disaggregation and collapse of the matrix, release of fines or formation of precipitates.\n\nSensitivity depends on the overall reactivity of the formation minerals with the fluid; reactivity depends on the structure of the rock and the distribution of minerals within the rock.\n\nSandstone sensitivity also depends on permeability; low-permeability formations are normally more sensitive than high-permeability sandstones for a given mineralogy because certain types of damage, such as formation of precipitates, are more harmful in small pore throats (as in low-permeability formations).\n\nSee:\ncompatibility, matrix stimulation, sandstone petrography",
  "separator": "1. n. [Production Facilities]\n\nA cylindrical or spherical vessel used to separate oil, gas and water from the total fluid stream produced by a well. Separators can be either horizontal or vertical.\n\nSeparators can be classified into two-phase and three-phase separators (commonly called free-water knockout). The two-phase type deals only with oil and gas, while the three-phase type handles oil, water and gas. Additionally, separators can be categorized according to their operating pressure. Low-pressure units handle pressures of 10 to 180 psi [69 to 1241 kPa]. Medium-pressure separators operate from 230 to 700 psi [1586 to 4826 kPa]. High-pressure units handle pressures of 975 to 1500 psi [6722 to 10, 342 kPa].\n\nGravity segregation is the main force that accomplishes the separation, which means the heaviest fluid settles to the bottom and the lightest fluid rises to the top. Additionally, inside the vessel, the degree of separation between gas and liquid will depend on the separator operating pressure, the residence time of the fluid mixture and the type of flow of the fluid. Turbulent flow allows more bubbles to escape than laminar flow.\n\nSee:\nfree-water knockout, horizontal separator, oil and gas separator, spherical separator, stage separation, three-phase separator, two-phase separator, vertical separator",

A sequence boundary is an erosional surface that separates cycles of deposition.\n\nSee:\nconformable, erosion, erosion, sequence, sequence stratigraphy, unconformity",
  "sequence stratigraphy": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nA field of study in which basin-filling sedimentary deposits, called sequences, are interpreted in a framework of eustasy, sedimentation and subsidence through time in order to correlate strata and predict the stratigraphy of relatively unknown areas. Sequences tend to show cyclicity of changes in relative sea level and widespread unconformities, processes of sedimentation and sources of sediments, climate and tectonic activity over time. Sequence stratigraphic study promotes thorough understanding of the evolution of basins, but also allows for interpretations of potential source rocks and reservoir rocks in both frontier areas (having seismic data but little well data) and in more mature hydrocarbon provinces. Prediction of reservoir continuity is currently a key question in mature hydrocarbon provinces where sequence stratigraphy is being applied.The field originated during the 1960s with the study of the stratigraphy of the continental USA, where numerous unconformities could be correlated widely, and led to the proposal that major unconformities might mark synchronous global-scale events. Through sequence stratigraphy, widely-separated sediments that occur between correlatable unconformities could be compared with each other. Studies of outcrops and seismic lines bore out these concepts, which initially were called \"Seismic Stratigraphy\" and first published widely in 1977. Further study of seismic lines led to the interpretation of the geometry or architecture of seismic events as representing particular styles of sedimentation and depositional environments, and the integration of such interpretations with well log and core data. Because of the simultaneous, competitive nature of the research, numerous oil companies and academic groups use the terminology of sequence stratigraphy differently, and new terms are added continually.\n\nSee:\naccommodation, aggradation, basin, chronostratigraphic chart, condensed section, correlation, depositional environment, downlap, eustasy, hiatus, onlap, parasequence, plate tectonics, progradation, regression, reservoir, retrogradation, sedimentation, sequence, sequence boundary, source rock, stratigraphy, stratum, subsidence, systems tract, transgression, unconformity",

Based on the idea of iterating from a first guess and refining through reduction of errors, the procedure generally transforms the model to normality, simulating the normally distributed transform, and then back-transforming to the original variable of interest.",
  "sequestering agent": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA chemical whose molecular structure can envelop and hold a certain type of ion in a stable and soluble complex. Divalent cations, such as hardness ions, form stable and soluble complex structures with several types of sequestering chemicals. When held inside the complex, the ions have a limited ability to react with other ions, clays or polymers. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a well-known sequestering agent for the hardness ions, such as Ca+2, and is the reagent solution used in the hardness test protocol published by API. Polyphosphates can also sequester hardness ions. The addition of sodium acid pyrophosphate (SAPP) to a cement-contaminated mud renders the calcium ions essentially nonreactive with clays in the mud. As a side benefit, SAPP also lowers mud pH. Sequestering is not the same as precipitation because sequestering does not form a solid.\n\nSee:\nEDTA, hardness ion, oxygen scavenger, precipitation, SAPP, scavenger, sulfide scavenger\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Completions, Drilling Fluids, Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nAnother term for chelating agent, a chemical used to bind metal ions to form a ring structure. Chelating agents stabilize or prevent the precipitation of damaging compounds. In the oil field, chelating agents are used in stimulation treatments and for cleaning surface facilities. They are also used to treat or remove scale or weighting agents in reservoir drilling fluids.\nDuring acid or scale-removal treatments, various compounds may be dissolved in the treatment fluid. As the acid reacts and the pH increases, reaction products may precipitate as a gelatinous, insoluble mass. Should this occur within the formation matrix, it is almost impossible to remove and permanent permeability damage may occur. Chelating agents prevent precipitation by keeping ions in a soluble form until the treatment fluid can be flowed back from the formation during cleanup.\nTypical oilfield chelating agents include EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid), HEDTA (hydroxyethylenediamine triacetic acid), NTA (nitriolotriacetic acid) and citric acid.\n\nSynonyms:\nchelating agent\n\nSee:\nacetic acid, chelation, reducing agent\n\n\n\n\n3. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nAnother term for chelating agent, a chemical added to an acid to stabilize iron. The injected acid dissolves iron from rust, millscale, iron scales or iron-containing minerals in the formation. Iron can exist as ferric iron [Fe+3] or ferrous iron [Fe+2]. If the iron is not controlled, it will precipitate insoluble products such as ferric hydroxide and, in sour environments, ferrous sulfide [FeS], which will damage the formation.\n\nChelating agents associate with iron [Fe+3 or Fe+2] to form soluble complexes. Citric acid, acetic acid and EDTA are effective chelating agents and can be used at temperatures up to 400oF [204oC].\n\nAlternate Form:\nchelating agent\n\nSee:\nreducing agent",

  "settling pit": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA drilling mud filled open steel or earthen berm tank that is not stirred or circulated. By having mud slowly pass through such a container, most large drilling solids sink to the bottom, cleaning the mud somewhat. If the settling pit is small, as in the case of steel mud tanks, it must be cleaned out frequently as cuttings pile up on the bottom of the tank. In the early days of rotary drilling, some rigs had no more solids control than a large settling pit into which mud was discharged after coming back from the wellbore and suction for the mud pumps was taken at the other end of the pit. A major drawback to this type of \"cleaning\" is that solids intentionally put into the mud, such as barite, may settle to the bottom and be discarded rather than circulated back into the wellbore.\n\nSee:\nbarite, cuttings, rotary drilling",

  "shadow zone": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nGenerally, an area of the Earth from which waves do not emerge or cannot be recorded. In seismology, the term is used to more specifically describe regions of the subsurface where P-waves and S-waves are difficult to detect, such as regions of the core at certain distances from the epicenter of an earthquake, or the point on the Earth's surface directly above an earthquake. Such zones were first observed in 1914 by Beno Gutenberg (1889 to 1960), an American geologist born in Germany. Because of the molten nature of the outer core, S-waves are especially difficult to detect at 103 to 142 degrees from the epicenter of an earthquake and not observable from 142 to 180 degrees from the epicenter. Areas below salt features are also called shadow zones because the high velocity of salt bends and traps energy, so seismic data quality beneath salt is generally poor unless special seismic processing is performed.\n\nSee:\nblind zone, P-wave, S-wave, seismology",
  "shaker": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAbbreviation for shale shaker, the primary and probably most important device on the rig for removing drilled solids from the mud. This vibrating sieve is simple in concept, but a bit more complicated to use efficiently. A wire-cloth screen vibrates while the drilling fluid flows on top of it. The liquid phase of the mud and solids smaller than the wire mesh pass through the screen, while larger solids are retained on the screen and eventually fall off the back of the device and are discarded. Obviously, smaller openings in the screen clean more solids from the whole mud, but there is a corresponding decrease in flow rate per unit area of wire cloth. Hence, the drilling crew should seek to run the screens (as the wire cloth is called), as fine as possible, without dumping whole mud off the back of the shaker. Where it was once common for drilling rigs to have only one or two shale shakers, modern high-efficiency rigs are often fitted with four or more shakers, thus giving more area of wire cloth to use, and giving the crew the flexibility to run increasingly fine screens.\n\nAlternate Form:\nshale shaker\n\nSee:\ncuttings, desander",
  "shale": "1. n. [Geology, Shale Gas]\n\nA fine-grained, fissile, detrital sedimentary rock formed by consolidation of clay- and silt-sized particles into thin, relatively impermeable layers. It is the most abundant sedimentary rock. Shale can include relatively large amounts of organic material compared with other rock types and thus has potential to become a rich hydrocarbon source rock, even though a typical shale contains just 1% organic matter. Its typical fine grain size and lack of permeability, a consequence of the alignment of its platy or flaky grains, allow shale to form a good cap rock for hydrocarbon traps.\n\nGas shows from shales during drilling have led some shales to be targeted as potential gas reservoirs. Various clay types and volumes influence the quality of the reservoir from a petrophysical and geomechanical perspective. The quality of shale reservoirs depends on their thickness and extent, organic content, thermal maturity, depth and pressure, fluid saturations, and permeability, among other factors.\n\nSee:\ncaprock, clastic sediment, clay, detrital, diapir, formation pressure, illite, impermeable, lamination, pore pressure, seal, sedimentary, shaly, siliciclastic sediment, source rock, trap\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

Shale is the most common, and certainly the most troublesome, rock type that must be drilled in order to reach oil and gas deposits. The characteristic that makes shales most troublesome to drillers is its water sensitivity, due in part to its clay content and the ionic composition of the clay. For this reason, oil-base drilling fluids are the mud of choice to drill the most water-sensitive shales.\n\nAlternate Form:\nsloughing shale\n\nSee:\nactivity of aqueous solutions, balanced-activity oil mud, cation exchange capacity, Chenevert method, clay, clay-water interaction, drilling detergent, encapsulation, gumbo, inhibit, inhibitive mud, montmorillonite, native clay, oil mud, pore-pressure transmission, potassium ion, relative humidity, silicate mud, synthetic-base mud",
  "shale baseline": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe average reading of the spontaneous potential (SP) log opposite the shale layers in a well. Opposite shales, the SP is relatively constant and changes only slowly with depth. This is the shale baseline. The log is normally adjusted by the logging engineer to read near zero at the baseline.

  "shear wave": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nAlso known as S-wave, an elastic body wave in which particles oscillate perpendicular to the direction in which the wave propagates. S-waves are generated by most land seismic sources, but not by air guns. P-waves that impinge on an interface at non-normal incidence can produce S-waves, which in that case are known as converted waves. S-waves can likewise be converted to P-waves. S-waves, or shear waves, travel more slowly than P-waves and cannot travel through fluids because fluids do not support shear. Recording of S-waves requires receivers coupled to the solid Earth. Interpretation of S-waves can allow determination of rock properties such as fracture density and orientation, Poisson's ratio and rock type by crossplotting P-wave and S-wave velocities, and by other techniques.\n\nSynonyms:\nS-wave, tangential wave\n\nSee:\nfour-component seismic data",

In an induction log, the skin effect causes a reduction of the R-signal (in-phase) and an increase in the X-signal (out-of-phase) at the receiver. It has a significant effect on the 6FF40 array, particularly below 1 ohm-m. Since the magnitude of the reduction depends on the conductivity, the skin effect can be corrected for by using a fixed function of the measured conductivity. A much improved method is to estimate the correction from the X-signal measured in balanced arrays.\n\nSee:\nbalanced array, induction\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Testing]\n\nAn increase or decrease in the pressure drop predicted with Darcy's law using the value of permeability thickness, kh, determined from a buildup or drawdown test. The difference is assumed to be caused by the \"skin.\" Skin effect can be either positive or negative. The skin effect is termed positive if there is an increase in pressure drop, and negative when there is a decrease, as compared with the predicted Darcy pressure drop. A positive skin effect indicates extra flow resistance near the wellbore, and a negative skin effect indicates flow enhancement near the wellbore. The terms skin effect and skin factor are often used interchangeably.

This value is highly dependent on the value of kh. For example, a 20-psi [138-kPa] total pressure drop related to skin effect could produce almost any skin factor, depending on the value of kh.

This operation is conducted when the bottomhole assembly has been fitted with a bent sub or a bent housing mud motor, or both, for directional drilling. Sliding is the predominant method to build and control or correct hole angle in modern directional drilling operations. Directional drilling is conceptually simple: Point the bit in the desired direction. This pointing is accomplished through the bent sub, which has a small angle offset from the axis of the drillstring, and a measurement device to determine the direction of offset. Without turning the drillstring, the bit is rotated with a mud motor, and drills in the direction it points. With steerable motors, when the desired wellbore direction is attained, the entire drillstring is rotated and drills straight rather than at an angle. By controlling the amount of hole drilled in the sliding versus the rotating mode, the wellbore trajectory can be controlled precisely.\n\nSee:\ncatwalk, directional drilling, mud motor, vee-door\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

Solvent injection is performed at several test pressures. Effluent production, density and composition are measured as functions of the injected volume. Oil recovery after injection of a specific number of pore volumes (PV) such as 1.2 PV of solvent is the test criterion for miscibility. Two trend lines appear on a plot of recovery versus pore pressure for several slim-tube tests. The point of intersection of those trend lines is the estimated MMP for the given oil-solvent system.

  "slimhole well": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn inexact term describing a borehole (and associated casing program) significantly smaller than a standard approach, commonly a wellbore less than 6 in. in diameter. The slimhole concept has its roots in the observed correlation between well costs and volume of rock extracted. If one can extract less rock, then well costs should fall. One form of slimhole work involves using more or less conventional equipment and procedures, but simply reducing the hole and casing sizes for each hole interval. A second form involves technology used for exploration boreholes in the hard rock mining industry. In the mining rig operations, the drillstem serves a dual purpose. After the hole is drilled, the drillstem remains in the hole and is cemented in place. Then a new drillstem is used for the new hole section, and also cemented in place. The drillstring for mining rig operations is rotated like that for conventional oilfield rotary rig operations, but typically at a much higher speed.",

  "slips": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA device used to grip the drillstring in a relatively nondamaging manner and suspend it in the rotary table.

On the drillpipe side (inside surface), the slips are fitted with replaceable, hardened tool steel teeth that embed slightly into the side of the pipe. The outsides of the slips are tapered to match the taper of the rotary table. After the rig crew places the slips around the drillpipe and in the rotary, the driller slowly lowers the drillstring. As the teeth on the inside of the slips grip the pipe, the slips are pulled down. This downward force pulls the outer wedges down, providing a compressive force inward on the drillpipe and effectively locking everything together. Then the rig crew can unscrew the upper portion of the drillstring (kelly, saver sub, a joint or stand of pipe) while the lower part is suspended. After some other component is screwed onto the lower part of the drillstring, the driller raises the drillstring to unlock the gripping action of the slips, and the rig crew removes the slips from the rotary.\n\nSee:\nkelly, make a connection, rotary table, saver sub, spinning chain, stand\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

[Formation Evaluation]\n\nA formation in which the velocity of the compressional wave traveling through the borehole fluid is greater than the velocity of the shear wave through the surrounding formation. In such conditions, there is no critical refraction of the shear wave and no shear head wave generated, so that standard techniques based on monopole transducers cannot be used to measure formation shear velocity. Instead, it is necessary to use dipole sources to excite the flexural mode. The velocity of the latter is closely related to that of the shear wave. In very slow formations, such as in high-porosity gas sands, the formation compressional velocity also may be less than the borehole fluid velocity, causing no compressional head wave.

  "spacer fluid": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAny liquid used to physically separate one special-purpose liquid from another. Special-purpose liquids are typically prone to contamination, so a spacer fluid compatible with each is used between the two. The most common spacer is simply water. However, chemicals are usually added to enhance its performance for the particular operation. Spacers are used primarily when changing mud types and to separate mud from cement during cementing operations. In the former, an oil-base fluid must be kept separate from a water-base fluid. In this case, the spacer may be base oil. In the latter operation, a chemically treated water spacer usually separates drilling mud from cement slurry. For proper performance and to prevent unanticipated problems, the spacer should be tested with each fluid in small-scale pilot tests. Some spacer fluids are designed to induce a particular flow regime. Ideally, a cement slurry should have turbulent flow to efficiently displace drilling fluids, but there might be pumping restrictions on fluid velocity. Therefore, a spacer that can achieve turbulent or pseudolaminar flow might be selected.\n\nSee:\ncement head, displacement",

  "spherical focusing": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA technique for focusing an electrode device based on maintaining a spherical equipotential surface centered at the main current electrode. Unlike the laterolog, which tries to maintain equipotential lines parallel to the sonde, spherical focusing tries to maintain the spherical equipotential lines that would exist in a homogeneous formation with no borehole. This is achieved with a particular arrangement of current-emitting electrode, current-return electrodes and monitor electrodes. This arrangement creates two spherical equipotential spheres with a constant voltage drop between them. The resistivity is determined from the current flowing between the spheres and the voltage drop. The depth of investigation is determined by the radii of the two spheres.

  "spine and ribs plot": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nFor a two-detector density tool, the plot of long-spacing versus short-spacing count rates for different formation densities, mudcake densities and mudcake thicknesses. The plot takes its name from the spine, which is the locus of points with no mudcake, and the ribs, which show the effect of mudcake at certain fixed formation densities. The plot illustrates graphically that for a given formation density there is only one rib for all normal mudcake densities and thicknesses. Thus, although there are three unknowns, it is possible to make a correction using two measurements.\n\nSee:\nazimuthal density, compensated density log, delta rho, density measurement",
  "spinner flowmeter": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA device for measuring in situ the velocity of fluid flow in a production or injection well based on the speed of rotation of an impeller, or spinner. The spinner can be helical, that is, longer than it is wide, or like a vane, which is similar to a fan blade. In both cases, the speed of rotation is measured and related to the effective velocity of the fluid. Friction and fluid viscosity cause the relationship to be slightly nonlinear at low effective velocities and introduce a threshold velocity below which the spinner does not turn. Results are interpreted using the multipass, two-pass or single-pass methods.\n\nThere are several types of spinner flowmeter. The most common device uses a small vane-like spinner, about 1.5 in. [3.8 cm] in diameter, allowing the logging tool to pass through the tubing and other restrictions before reaching the reservoir interval. The small spinner captures only part of the fluid flow in the casing, too little to make it turn in some low flow-rate wells and possibly unrepresentative in multiphase flow settings. Other devices have been designed to capture more of the flow, for example the fullbore spinner and various types of flow-concentrating or diverter spinners, such as the packer flowmeter and the basket flowmeter.\n\nSee:\nbasket flowmeter, flow profile, packer flowmeter, production log",
  "spinner reversal": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nThe change in direction of rotation that occurs when a spinner flowmeter tool is moving in the same direction, but faster, than the fluid. When the tool is stationary, moving against the fluid flow, or moving in the same direction but slower than the flow, it will rotate in one direction, perhaps clockwise. However, if it moves in the same direction, but faster than the fluid, it will rotate counterclockwise. This may happen at the bottom of a producing well, and, unless identified, can lead to a false interpretation.\n\nSee:\neffective velocity, flow profile, multipass method, single-pass method, spinner flowmeter, threshold velocity, two-pass method, velocity correction factor",
  "spinning chain": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA length of ordinary steel link chain used by the drilling crew to cause pipe being screwed together to turn rapidly. This is accomplished by first carefully wrapping the chain around the lower half of the tool joint that is hanging off in the slips, stabbing another joint into that one, and then throwing the chain in such a manner that it wraps itself on the new upper joint. At the proper time, the driller must pull tension on the chain while a member of the floor crew holds some tension on the free end of the chain. This causes the new drillpipe joint to act like a spool, and as the driller pulls the chain on one end using the drawworks, the spool (or new pipe joint) turns and screws into the joint hung off in the slips. If the floor crew members are not extremely careful, loose clothing or worse, fingers, may become trapped in the unspooling chain and be severely damaged or cut off. Most rig contractors have discontinued the use of spinning chains because of high accident rates. The chains are still available on the rigs, but are not routinely used, having been replaced with other mechanical spinning devices.\n\nSee:\ndrawworks, kelly spinner, slips, tool joint",
  "spinning-drop tensiometer": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA standard laboratory instrument to measure interfacial tension. The method is particularly applicable to values of interfacial tension below 1 mN/m and especially below 10-2 mN/m, as may occur when employing surfactants for enhanced oil recovery. The method utilizes a tube containing a drop of the less-dense phase within the more-dense phase. When the tube is spun along its long axis at high speed, the resulting forces center the drop on the tube axis and deform it. The interfacial tension is a function of the shape of the deformed drop, the liquid densities and the rotation speed. Advanced versions of the instrument can periodically vary the rotation rate. The phase lag between the change of rotation rate and the drop deformation can be used to determine both interfacial elasticity and interfacial viscosity.\n\nSee:\ninterfacial tension, pendant-drop tensiometer",
  "spiral borehole": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nAnother term for corkscrew hole, the result of certain drilling conditions that cause the borehole to take the shape of a corkscrew. Most logging tools are much longer than the wavelength of the corkscrew, and therefore see it as a change in standoff or a change in hole size. For this reason, the corkscrew is often observed as a wave on the caliper log. A corkscrew hole affects measurements sensitive to standoff, such as induction and neutron porosity, and may affect pad tools, if they cannot follow the changes.\n\nSynonyms:\ncorkscrew hole\n\nSee:\nbad hole, cave effect",

  "spontaneous potential": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nNaturally occurring (static) electrical potential in the Earth. Spontaneous potentials are usually caused by charge separation in clay or other minerals, by the presence of a semipermeable interface impeding the diffusion of ions through the pore space of rocks, or by natural flow of a conducting fluid (salty water) through the rocks. Variations in SP can be measured in the field and in wellbores to determine variations of ionic concentration in pore fluids of rocks.\n\nAlternate Form:\nSP\n\nSee:\ndiffusion\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA log of the natural difference in electrical potential, in millivolts, between an electrode in the borehole and a fixed reference electrode on the surface. The most useful component of this difference is the electrochemical potential since it can cause a significant deflection opposite permeable beds. The magnitude of the deflection depends mainly on the salinity contrast between drilling mud and formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed. The spontaneous potential (SP) log is therefore used to detect permeable beds and to estimate formation water salinity and formation clay content. The SP log cannot be recorded in nonconductive mud.\n\nThe SP can be affected by several factors that make interpretation difficult. First, there are other possible sources of electrical potential not related to the electrochemical effect, for example, the electrokinetic potential and bimetallism. Many of these are small and constant throughout the log, and can be lumped together in the shale baseline. Second, the SP can measure only the potential drop in the borehole, and not the full electrochemical potential. The ideal SP opposite a clean bed is known as the static spontaneous potential (SSP), and opposite a shaly bed as the pseudostatic spontaneous potential (PSP). The SP is always less than the SSP or the PSP and more rounded at the boundaries between shales and permeable beds.\n\nThe SP was first recognized by C. Schlumberger, M. Schlumberger and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Russian oil fields.\n\nSee:\ndifferential SP, fish, liquid-junction potential, membrane potential",

The lignite, lignin, tannins, cellulose, starches and fatty acids found in many mud systems are carbon food sources for SRB. Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater. Bacteria accumulation can lead to pitting of steel, and the buildup of H2S increases the corrosiveness of the water, thus increasing the possibility of hydrogen blistering or sulfide stress cracking.\n\nAlternate Form:\nsulfate-reducing bacteria",

The actual time period is rather arbitrary and depends on the location and the people involved. For shut-in wells, stabilization refers to a reasonably constant pressure. Stabilized pressures are commonly used as starting points for well tests.\n\nIn reality, the time to stabilization at truly constant pressure and rate is infinite. The target stabilization for rigorous testing in gas wells is pseudosteady-state flow, and this may be recognized as the pressure change versus time predicted from formation properties and drainage area size.

The operating pressures are sequentially reduced, so the highest pressure is found at the first separator and the lowest pressure at the final separator.\n\nThe objective of stage separation is to maximize the hydrocarbon liquid recovery and to provide maximum stabilization to the resultant phases (liquid and gas) leaving the final separator. Stabilization means that considerable amounts of gas or liquid will not evolve from the final liquid and gas phases, respectively, in places such as stock tanks or gas pipelines.

They consist of about 27% linear polymer (amylose) and about 73% branched polymer (amylopectin). The two polymers are intertwined within starch granules. Granules are insoluble in cold water, but soaking in hot water or under steam pressure ruptures their covering and the polymers hydrate into a colloidal suspension. This product is a pregelatinized starch and has been used in muds for many years. Amylose and amylopectin are nonionic polymers that do not interact with electrolytes. Derivatized starches, such as hydroxypropyl and carboxymethyl starches, are used in drill-in fluids, completion fluids and various brine systems as well as in drilling-mud systems.

The static spontaneous potential (SSP) is equal to the electrochemical potential. When current is flowing, the SP measures only that fraction of the potential drop that occurs in the borehole. In normal conditions, this potential drop is much higher than the drop in the formation because the cross-sectional area of the borehole is much smaller, and hence its resistance much higher. It is for this reason that in the middle of a thick, clean bed whose resistivity is not too high, the SP reads close to the SSP. However, in other conditions the SP is significantly less than the SSP.\n\nAs well as ignoring shaliness in the sand, the SSP ignores other sources of potential and assumes a surrounding shale that is a perfect cationic membrane.\n\nSee:\nelectrokinetic potential, liquid-junction potential, membrane potential, pseudostatic spontaneous potential, shale baseline",

The latent heat of vaporization for steam is very high, and when the steam condenses in the reservoir a significant amount of heat is transferred from the steam to the formation rock and fluids. Since steam is lighter and more mobile than oil, gravity differences and channeling of the steam through the most permeable parts of the reservoir can create sweep efficiency problems during steam-injection processes.\n\nTo increase sweep efficiency, there are two categories of improvements. The first is operational changes such as selective completion of injector wells, fracturing operations and constructing horizontal wells, and the second is the use of additives in the steam. For example, water-soluble surfactants modify interfacial properties of the oil-water system, and foams reduce steam mobility.\n\nSee:\ncyclic steam injection, injection well, steamflood, surfactant, thermal recovery",
  "steam chamber": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery, Heavy Oil]\n\nThe volume of reservoir in which mobile steam exists for an extended period of time.

  "steamflood": "1. n. [Heavy Oil, Enhanced Oil Recovery, Well Completions]\n\nA method of thermal recovery in which steam generated at surface is injected into the reservoir through specially distributed injection wells.\n\nWhen steam enters the reservoir, it heats up the crude oil and reduces its viscosity. The heat also distills light components of the crude oil, which condense in the oil bank ahead of the steam front, further reducing the oil viscosity. The hot water that condenses from the steam and the steam itself generate an artificial drive that sweeps oil toward producing wells.\n\nAnother contributing factor that enhances oil production during steam injection is related to near-wellbore cleanup. In this case, steam reduces the interfacial tension that ties paraffins and asphaltenes to the rock surfaces while steam distillation of crude oil light ends creates a small solvent bank that can miscibly remove trapped oil.\n\nSteamflooding is also called continuous steam injection or steam drive.\n\nSee:\ncyclic steam injection, enhanced oil recovery, hot waterflooding, in-situ combustion, paraffin, secondary recovery",

Physically, the effect can be seen as a coupling of the Stoneley energy into a formation wave known as the slow wave, as predicted by the Biot theory. The amount of reduction is a complicated function of this mobility (or permeability divided by viscosity), the properties of the borehole fluid, the pore fluid and the mudcake, the elastic properties of the rock and the frequency.

Where mud is stored, precautions should always be taken when handling or reconditioning water muds containing lignosulfonates, gypsum (sulfate sources) and starches, cellulose, xanthan gum and lignite (food sources). These muds can harbor SRB and can have high sulfide accumulations. Mud filtrate should be tested with the Garrett Gas Train to determine sulfide concentration in a stored mud, followed by treatments with caustic soda to raise pH and zinc-based scavengers to remove sulfides as ZnS. Before storage of mud, treatment with a bactericide can inhibit SRB growth. Also, circulating mud from time to time, with air entrainment, can retard development of anaerobic conditions.\n\nAnaerobic bacteria can convert the sulfate or sulfite present in water handling facilities to hydrogen sulfide [H2S]. This by-product, combined with iron, can form iron sulfide, a scale that is very difficult to remove. SRB occur naturally in surface waters, including seawater.

Active sulfides include calcium sulfide and bisulfide formed when H2S reacts with lime in an oil mud. Their accumulation constitutes a safety concern at the rig because of the risk of reverting to H2S gas should an acidic influx occur.

  "tapered cutoff": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nIn a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, the use of a gradual rather than a sharp cutoff to distinguish between bound water and free water. A sharp cutoff at, for example T2 = 33 ms in sandstones, is normally used to distinguish free water (all T2s above 33 ms) from bound water (all T2s below 33ms). In a water-filled rock, in the fast diffusion limit, T2 is directly related to pore size. The distinction between bound and free water is based on the assumption that all free water resides in large pores, and all bound water in small pores. However, in rocks with large pores, a significant volume of bound water exists on the surface of the grains around a large pore. Being part of a large pore, it gives a long T2 and will be incorrectly counted as free water. One solution is the tapered cutoff, in which the bound water is the sum of all the T2 below a minimum, for example 5 ms, and is then a progressively smaller fraction of the volume at T2s up to a maximum, for example 500 ms. All signal above 500 ms represents free water. The form of the taper is usually empirical, but is based on some model of pore shape, such as a bundle of tubes.\n\nSee Kleinberg RL and Boyd A: 'Tapered Cutoffs for Magnetic Resonance Bound Water Volume' paper SPE 38737, presented at the SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, San Antonio, Texas, USA, October 5-8, 1997.\n\nSee:\nbound fluid, bound water, free water, irreducible water, nuclear magnetic resonance measurement",

  "tectonics": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nAlso known as plate tectonics, the unifying geologic theory developed to explain observations that interactions of the brittle plates of the lithosphere with each other and with the softer underlying asthenosphere result in large-scale changes in the Earth. The theory of plate tectonics initially stemmed from observations of the shapes of the continents, particularly South America and Africa, which fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle and have similar rocks and fossils despite being separated by a modern ocean. As lithospheric plates heat up or cool down depending on their position, or their tectonic environment, relative to each other and to warmer areas deeper within the Earth, they become relatively more or less dense than the asthenosphere and thus tend to rise as molten magma or sink in cold, brittle slabs or slide past each other. Mountain belts can form during plate collisions or an orogeny; diverging plates or rifts can create new midoceanic ridges; plates that slide past one another create transform fault zones (such as the San Andreas fault); and zones of subduction occur where one lithospheric plate moves beneath another. Plate tectonic theory can explain such phenomena as earthquakes, volcanic or other igneous activity, midoceanic ridges and the relative youth of the oceanic crust, and the formation of sedimentary basins on the basis of their relationships to lithospheric plate boundaries. Convection of the mantle is postulated to be the driving mechanism for the movement of lithospheric plates. Measurements of the continents using the Global Positioning System confirm the relative motions of plates. Age determinations of the oceanic crust confirm that such crust is much younger than that of the continents and has been recycled by the process of subduction and regenerated at midoceanic ridges.\n\nSynonyms:\nplate tectonics\n\nSee:\nactive margin, aulacogen, basin, core, craton, earthquake, eustasy, Global Positioning System, isostasy, midoceanic ridge, normal fault, orogeny, passive margin, preservation, rift, rock, sedimentary basin, sequence stratigraphy, transform fault, Wadati-Benioff zone",

  "tortuosity": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA measure of the geometric complexity of a porous medium. Tortuosity is a ratio that characterizes the convoluted pathways of fluid diffusion and electrical conduction through porous media. In the fluid mechanics of porous media, tortuosity is the ratio of the length of a streamline—a flow line or path—between two points to the straight-line distance between those points. Tortuosity is thus related to the ratio of a fluid's diffusion coefficient when it is not confined by a porous medium to its effective diffusion coefficient when confined in a porous medium. Tortuosity is also related to the formation factor, which is the ratio of electrical resistivity of a conductive fluid in a porous medium to the electrical resistivity of the fluid itself.\nIn some literature, tortuosity denotes the square of the ratio defined above, whereas in other literature, the term tortuosity factor is used for the square of the ratio.\n\nSee:\na, formation factor\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

  "tracer measurement": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA technique in which a tracer is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well to determine fluid paths and velocities. Radioactive tracers have been used from the 1940s and are still common for determining flow profiles in injection wells. Tracers with high neutron-capture cross section, such as borax or high-salinity water, were introduced in the 1970s to record injection/pulsed neutron logs. In multiphase production wells, special tracers were introduced in the 1990s to move with only one phase, so as to give a phase-velocity log.

  "tracer-ejector measurement": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nAnother term for velocity-shot measurement, a method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used.\nVelocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 bbl/d [16 m3/d]. They are not usually run in production wells because of problems of tracer disposal. In multiphase flow, the tracer most often travels with the continuous phase, thereby giving a type of phase-velocity log.\n\nSynonyms:\nvelocity shot measurement\n\nSee:\ninterval method, production log, timed slug analysis, tracer measurement, tracer-loss measurement",
  "tracer-loss measurement": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA method of determining injection-flow profiles by monitoring the reduction in tracer material as it moves down the well. A slug of radioactive tracer is added to the injection fluid. As the slug moves down the well, several gamma ray logs are recorded at well-defined time intervals. The position of the slug is seen as a large gamma ray peak whose size is proportional to the flow rate. A reduction in the size of the peak indicates a loss of fluid into the formation. Fluid velocity can be calculated from the time interval and the distance the peak has moved using timed-slug analysis. Tracer-loss measurements produce a type of radioactive-tracer log, used mainly to give a general idea of fluid flow in low flow-rate wells.\n\nIn very low flow-rate wells, an alternative technique has been used in which the gamma ray detector is held stationary at some depth until the slug has passed. The detector is then moved down to another depth to observe the slug again. With these data, it is possible to make quantitative estimates of fluid flow.\n\nSee:\nmultiple-isotope log, production log, tracer measurement, velocity shot measurement",

The tube wave travels down the wellbore along the interface between the fluid in the wellbore and the wall of the wellbore. A tube wave suffers little energy loss and typically retains a very high amplitude which interferes with reflected arrivals occurring later in time on vertical seismic profile (VSP) data. Because the tube wave is coupled to the formation through which it is traveling, it can perturb the formation across open fractures intersecting the borehole. This squeezing effect can generate secondary tube waves which travel both up and down from the fracture location.

Initially, the technique was developed as a means for conveying the gun string on the production tubing, with the guns remaining in the well until they are removed during the first workover. The subsequent popularity of highly deviated and horizontal wells increased the requirement for tubing-conveyed perforating as the only means of gaining access to the perforating depth.

  "tuning effect": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nA phenomenon of constructive or destructive interference of waves from closely spaced events or reflections. At a spacing of less than one-quarter of the wavelength, reflections undergo constructive interference and produce a single event of high amplitude. At spacing greater than that, the event begins to be resolvable as two separate events. The tuning thickness is the bed thickness at which two events become indistinguishable in time, and knowing this thickness is important to seismic interpreters who wish to study thin reservoirs. The tuning thickness can be expressed by the following formula:Z = VI/2.8 fmax, where Z = tuning thickness of a bed, equal to 1/4 of the wavelengthVI = interval velocity of the targetfmax = maximum frequency in the seismic section.The equation assumes that the interfering wavelets are identical in frequency content and are zero-phase and is useful when planning a survey to determine the maximum frequency needed to resolve a given thickness.

  "turbidity current": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nAn influx of rapidly moving, sediment-laden water down a slope into a larger body of water; also called a density current because the suspended sediment results in the current having a higher density than the clearer water into which it flows. Such currents can occur in lakes and oceans, in some cases as by-products of earthquakes or mass movements such as slumps. The sedimentary deposits that form as the current loses energy are called turbidites and can be preserved as Bouma sequences.

  "turbulent flow": "1. n. [Well Completions]\n\nA fluid-flow regime characterized by swirling or chaotic motion as the fluid moves along the pipe or conduit. The linear velocity of the fluid particles is similar regardless of position in the conduit, although particles close to the conduit walls have a lower velocity.

[Production Logging]\n\nA type of flow for single-phase fluids in which the velocity at any point may vary in both direction and magnitude with time. Turbulent flow is characterized by random, irregular, locally circular currents, or vortices.

  "turnkey": "1. adj. [Drilling]\n\nA type of financing arrangement for the drilling of a wellbore that places considerable risk and potential reward on the drilling contractor. Under such an arrangement, the drilling contractor assumes full responsibility for the well to some predetermined milestone such as the successful running of logs at the end of the well, the successful cementing of casing in the well or even the completion of the well. Until this milestone is reached, the operator owes nothing to the contractor. The contractor bears all risk of trouble in the well, and in extreme cases, may have to abandon the well entirely and start over. In return for assuming such risk, the price of the well is usually a little higher than the well would cost if relatively trouble free. Therefore, if the contractor succeeds in drilling a trouble-free well, the fee added as contingency becomes profit. Some operators, however, have been required by regulatory agencies to remedy problem wells, such as blowouts, if the turnkey contractor does not.\n\nSee:\nblowout, casing, cementing, completion, contract depth, drilling contractor",

  "two-pass method": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA technique for interpreting the results from a spinner flowmeter using two logging runs over the zone of interest, one up and one down. If the two passes are run at the same cable speed, they will overlay below the perforations, where there is no flow. If they were not run at the same speed, the curves are shifted to overlay. Elsewhere, the separation between the curves gives the relative contribution of each zone. Viscosity changes should have a small effect, since they will have the same influence on both passes.\n\nThe technique is applicable when the flow is single-phase, or else multiphase with a sufficiently homogeneous-flow regime, such as with emulsion or dispersed bubble flow.\n\nSee:\neffective velocity, flow profile, flow regime, multipass method, single-pass method, spinner flowmeter, spinner reversal, threshold velocity, velocity correction factor",

[Well Testing]\n\nA method for quantifying well and reservoir parameters such as permeability, skin, fracture half-length, dual-porosity parameters, and others, by comparing the pressure change and its derivative of the acquired data to reservoir model curve families, called type curves. When a match is found between data and a type curve, the parameters that characterize the behavior of the model providing a match are thereby determined.\n\nOriginally, type-curve analysis was done manually using only the pressure change. With the introduction of the pressure derivative, the analysis requires matching both pressure change and its derivative. Computer-assisted matching permits rigorous accounting for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during (in the case of drawdown analysis) the transient data acquisition, as well as providing a continuum of solutions instead of a type-curve family derived from discrete values for the governing parameters.\n\nSee:\nsuperposition in time, type curves",
  "type curves": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nFamilies of the paired pressure change and its derivative computed from a model. The model is usually generated from an analytical solution of the diffusion equation with boundary conditions strategically defined to enable observation of theoretical trends in the pressure-transient response. The boundary conditions that can be defined near the well include constant or variable wellbore storage, limited entry (partial penetration), radial composite (damage skin due to permeability alteration), and a fracture extending the cylindrical wellbore to a extended plane. The borehole trajectory can be vertical, angled, or horizontal. The distant boundary conditions include a sealing or partially sealing planar boundary (fault), intersecting faults and rectangular boundaries (sealing or constant pressure). Further, the diffusion equation can be adjusted to accommodate reservoir heterogeneity in the form of dual porosity or layering. Finally, when generated with computer assistance, the type-curve family can account for superposition in time due to flow-rate variations before and even during the transient data acquisition.\n\nOriginally, type-curve families were printed on specialized (usually log-log) coordinates with dimensionless parameters defining the x and y axes. Today, commercial software can generate the type-curve families on the computer screen, enabling a much more flexible and user-friendly analysis. Further, automated regression (usually least squares) permits an optimized match between the acquired data and a selected model.\n\nType curves have greatly enriched the ability of interpreters to extract potential explanations for transient data trends that differ from the radial-flow behavior required for conventional semilog (Horner buildup) analysis.\n\nSee:\ndiffusion equation, superposition in time",

Perceptions of these factors inevitably change over time and often differ among users of the term. At present, the term is used in reference to oil and gas resources whose porosity, permeability, fluid trapping mechanism, or other characteristics differ from conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs.

This crossflow from one zone to another can occur when a high-pressure zone is encountered, the well flows, and the drilling crew reacts properly and closes the blowout preventers (BOPs). Pressure in the annulus then builds up to the point at which a weak zone fractures. Depending on the pressure at which the fracturing occurs, the flowing formation can continue to flow and losses continue to occur in the fractured zone.

Velocity can be determined from laboratory measurements, acoustic logs, vertical seismic profiles or from velocity analysis of seismic data. Velocity can vary vertically, laterally and azimuthally in anisotropic media such as rocks, and tends to increase with depth in the Earth because compaction reduces porosity. Velocity also varies as a function of how it is derived from the data.

[Production Logging]\n\nA method of producing a radioactive-tracer log, in which a slug of radioactive material is injected into the flow stream of a production or injection well from one section of a logging tool and observed as it passes one or more gamma ray detectors in another section. The slug, or shot, causes a peak in the gamma ray reading as it passes a detector. The flow velocity is determined from the difference in the time of arrival of the slug at the two detectors, or between ejector and detector. This technique has been applied for many years using radioactive tracers such as iodine. Water-soluble tracers are the most common, but oil- and gas-soluble tracers are also used. Velocity-shot measurements are recorded with the tool stationary. They are more accurate than flowmeters at low flow rates, below approximately 100 B/D [16m3/d].

  "vertical resolution": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA distance that characterizes the ability of a logging tool to resolve changes parallel to the tool axis. The word vertical implies a vertical well, but the term is used at other wellbore deviations. The vertical resolution summarizes the vertical response of the measurement in one or more distances. Most quoted vertical resolutions assume a homogeneous formation with stated properties. Vertical resolutions can vary considerably in more complex conditions, and at different values of the properties concerned. They should be considered only a qualitative guide to tool response.\n\nThere are several different definitions of the vertical resolution distance. First, and most commonly, it is the interval within which a large percentage, typically 90%, of the vertical response occurs. Second, it is the minimum bed thickness needed for the measurement to read within a small percentage, typically 10%, of the true value at the center of the bed. Third, it may refer to the smallest bed thickness for which a significant change can be detected by the measurement.\n\nFor acoustic and electromagnetic propagation measurements, it is taken, with reasonable accuracy, as the span of the receiver array. For nuclear and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, which must be acquired during a significant time interval, the vertical resolution also depends on the logging speed and the precision required.\n\nSee:\nalpha processing, electromagnetic propagation measurement, geometrical factor, nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, radial response",

For some measurements, mainly resistivity, the vertical response can be shaped as desired through signal processing. In general, the vertical response depends on the formation properties throughout the measurement volume. Most quoted vertical responses have been determined in formations that are radially homogeneous and have small vertical changes. They can then be summarized by a geometrical factor or a pseudogeometrical factor.

  "vertical seismic profile (VSP)": "1. n.

Purely defined, VSP refers to measurements made in a vertical wellbore using geophones inside the wellbore and a source at the surface near the well. In the more general context, VSPs vary in the well configuration, the number and location of sources and geophones, and how they are deployed. Most VSPs use a surface seismic source, which is commonly a vibrator on land and an air gun in offshore or marine environments. VSPs include the zero-offset VSP, offset VSP, walkaway VSP, walk-above VSP, salt-proximity VSP, shear-wave VSP, and drill-noise or seismic-while-drilling VSP. A VSP is a much more detailed survey than a check-shot survey because the geophones are more closely spaced, typically on the order of 25 m [82 ft], whereas a check-shot survey might include measurements of intervals hundreds of meters apart. Also, a VSP uses the reflected energy contained in the recorded trace at each receiver position as well as the first direct path from source to receiver. The check-shot survey uses only the direct path traveltime.

  "water-cut meter": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA device for determining the water holdup in a producing well by measuring the capacitance or impedance of the fluid.

Since hydrocarbons travel faster than water in a production well, the water holdup is larger than the water cut.

  "water-flow log": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nA record of the velocity and direction of water flowing in and around a borehole based on oxygen activation. The log may also include estimates of the flow volume and the distance from tool to flowing water.

Hence, water flow can be detected by oxygen activation, which, being a nuclear technique, is sensitive to flow inside and outside the casing. The measurement is sensitive to small flows, and can be configured to measure upward or downward flow. It is particularly useful as a leak and channel detector, to identify locations of water entry or exit and as a measurement of water velocity in multiphase flow. Logs may be continuous, but the most accurate measurements are made with the tool stationary.\n\nAlthough first tried in the 1960s, the log was not fully studied and implemented until the late 1970s with a purpose-built experimental tool. Standard pulsed-neutron spectroscopy tools were modified to record the log in the 1980s.\n\nSee:\nactivation log, impulse activation, phase velocity log, production log, pulsed neutron spectroscopy measurement",

The wavelet originates as a packet of energy from the source point, having a specific origin in time, and is returned to the receivers as a series of events distributed in time and energy. The distribution is a function of velocity and density changes in the subsurface and the relative position of the source and receiver. The energy that returns cannot exceed what was input, so the energy in any received wavelet decays with time as more partitioning takes place at interfaces. Wavelets also decay due to the loss of energy as heat during propagation. This is more extensive at high frequency, so wavelets tend to contain less high-frequency energy relative to low frequencies at longer traveltimes.

Wavelets may also be extracted by using a model for the reflections in a seismic trace, such as a synthetic seismogram. A wavelet is generated by deconvolving the trace with the set of reflection coefficients of the synthetic seismogram, a process also known as deterministic wavelet extraction. Wavelets may be extracted without a model for the reflections by generating a power spectrum of the data. By making certain assumptions, such as that the power spectrum contains information about the wavelet (and not the geology) and that the wavelet is of a certain phase (minimum, zero), a wavelet may be generated. This is also called statistical wavelet extraction. A particular processing approach to establishing the embedded wavelet is to compare the processed seismic response with the response measured by a vertical seismic profile (VSP) or generated synthetically through a synthetic seismogram in which the embedded wavelet is known. The wavelet can also be extracted through the autocorrelation of the seismic trace, in which case the phase of the wavelet has to be assumed.\n\nSee:\nsynthetic seismogram, vertical seismic profile",

Mud weight controls hydrostatic pressure in a wellbore and prevents unwanted flow into the well. The weight of the mud also prevents collapse of casing and the openhole.

Mud weight (density) test procedures using a mud balance have been standardized and published by the API.\n\nSynonyms:\nmud density\n\nSee:\nequivalent circulating density, high-gravity solids, mud, mud balance, pressurized mud balance, PVT, recorded data, sag, slug, weighting material",
  "weight indicator": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nOne of the instruments that the driller uses to monitor and improve the operating efficiencies of the drilling operation. The actual measurement of weight is made with a hydraulic gauge attached to the dead line of the drilling line. As tension increases in the drilling line, more hydraulic fluid is forced through the instrument, turning the hands of the indicator. The weight that is measured includes everything exerting tension on the wire rope, including the traveling blocks and cable itself. Hence, to have an accurate weight measurement of the drillstring, the driller must first make a zero offset adjustment to account for the traveling blocks and items other than the drillstring. Then the indicated weight will represent the drillstring (drillpipe and bottomhole assembly). However, the driller is only nominally interested in this weight for most operations. The weight of interest is the weight applied to the bit on the bottom of the hole. The driller could simply take the rotating and hanging off bottom weight, say 300, 000 pounds [136, 200 kg], and subtract from that the amount of rotating on bottom weight, say 250, 000 pounds [113, 500 kg], to get a bit weight of 50, 000 pounds [22, 700 kg]. However, most rigs are equipped with a weight indicator that has a second indicator dial that can be set to read zero (\"zeroed\") with the drillstring hanging free, and works backwards from the main indicator dial. After proper zeroing, any weight set on bottom (that takes weight away from the main dial), has the effect of adding weight to this secondary dial, so that the driller can read weight on bit directly from the dial.\n\nSee:\ndrill collar, traveling block\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA device or system used to measure, display and record the weight of a tubing string, slickline string or coiled tubing string in the wellbore.

[Enhanced Oil Recovery, Heavy Oil]\n\nAn in situ combustion technique in which water is injected simultaneously or alternately with air into a formation.\n\nWet combustion actually refers to wet forward combustion and was developed to use the great amount of heat that would otherwise be lost in the formation. The injected water recovers the heat from behind the burning front and transfers it to the oil bank ahead. Because of this additional energy, the oil displacement is more efficient and requires less air. In spite of these advantages, a wet combustion process cannot avoid liquid-blocking problems and use of wet combustion is limited by the oil viscosity.\n\nWet combustion is also called in situ steam generation or a combination of forward combustion and waterflooding, which is abbreviated as COFCAW.\n\nAlternate Form:\nCOFCAW\n\nSee:\ndry combustion, dry forward combustion, reverse combustion",

  "wet-clay porosity": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe proportion of a wet clay that is clay-bound water. A formation that has 100% clay would have a porosity equal to the wet-clay porosity (WCLP), all of it being clay-bound water, and a volume of dry clay equal to (1 - WCLP). The concept is used to relate the volume of clay-bound water, CBW, to the volume of dry clay, Vdcl, in an actual rock, since the ratio of the two is the same and equal to:\n\n\nCBW / Vdcl = WCLP / (1 - WCLP).\n\nSee:\ndual water, electrical double layer",
  "wettability": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery, Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe preference of a solid to contact one liquid or gas, known as the wetting phase, rather than another. The wetting phase will tend to spread on the solid surface and a porous solid will tend to imbibe the wetting phase, in both cases displacing the nonwetting phase. Rocks can be water-wet, oil-wet or intermediate-wet. The intermediate state between water-wet and oil-wet can be caused by a mixed-wet system, in which some surfaces or grains are water-wet and others are oil-wet, or a neutral-wet system, in which the surfaces are not strongly wet by either water or oil. Both water and oil wet most materials in preference to gas, but gas can wet sulfur, graphite and coal.\n\nWettability affects relative permeability, electrical properties, nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times and saturation profiles in the reservoir. The wetting state impacts waterflooding and aquifer encroachment into a reservoir.\n\nReservoir wetting preference can be determined by measuring the contact angle of crude oil and formation water on silica or calcite crystals or by measuring the characteristics of core plugs in either an Amott imbibition test or a USBM test.\n\nSee:\ncore plug, drainage, imbibition, magnetic resonance, relaxation time",
  "wettability change": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery, Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA type of damage in which the formation wettability is modified, generating a change in relative permeability that eventually affects well productivity.\n\nSurfactants or other additives in drilling fluids, especially oil-base mud, or other injected fluids can change formation wettability. A naturally water-wet formation could be changed into an oil-wet formation with consequent production impairment caused by reduction of oil relative permeability.\n\nWettability change is normally treated with mutual solvents to remove the rock-oil coating (asphaltene or paraffin precipitation), followed by a strong water-wet surfactant to reduce the tendency of further hydrocarbon precipitation.\n\nSee:\ndrilling fluid",
  "whole core": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA complete section of a conventionally drilled core. The section may be up to about 2 feet [0.6 m] in length, with typical core diameters lying between 1.75 and 5.25 in. [4.4 and 13.3 cm]. The term full-diameter core is also used, but generally refers to shorter sections of about 6 in. [15 cm]. The advantage of whole core analysis is that it measures properties on a larger scale, closer to that of the reservoir. This is particularly important for heterogeneous formations such as many carbonates or fractured materials.\n\nSee:\ncore plug, routine core analysis, sidewall core",
  "whole-mud dilution": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA dilution process which involves selective dumping of the active system (such as sand traps and \"bottoms up\" mud) and replacement of the lost volume with fresh mud.

  "wildcat": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn exploration well. The significance of this type of well to the drilling crew and well planners is that by definition, little if anything about the subsurface geology is known with certainty, especially the pressure regime. This higher degree of uncertainty necessitates that the drilling crews be appropriately skilled, experienced and aware of what various well parameters are telling them about the formations they drill. The crews must operate top-quality equipment, especially the blowout preventers, since a kick could occur at virtually any time. If a wildcat is especially far from another wellbore, it may be described as a \"rank wildcat.\"\n\nSee:\nblowout preventer, offset well, tight hole",
  "window": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nAnother term for aperture, a portion of a dataset, such as seismic data, to which functions or filters are applied.

The term wing valve typically is used when referring to the flowing wing.",
  "Winsor phase behavior": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA distinction among three phase behaviors of oil, water and surfactant systems when they form a microemulsion. The salinity of the brine phase is an important parameter influencing which type of behavior occurs. To test for the type of system, surfactant is added to an oil-water system. In a Winsor Type I system, the surfactant forms an oil-in-water microemulsion in the aqueous phase. This behavior is not favorable to achieve ultralow interfacial tension with surfactants. In a Winsor Type II system, the surfactant forms a water-in-oil emulsion in the oil phase. This behavior leads to surfactant retention in the oil phase and is unfavorable for an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. In a Winsor Type III system, the surfactant forms a microemulsion in a separate phase between the oil and aqueous phases. This phase is a continuous layer containing surfactant, water and dissolved hydrocarbons. This situation is ideal to achieve ultralow interfacial tension values and is favorable for EOR.\n\nSee:\nmicroemulsion",
  "wiper plug": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAnother term for cementing plug, a rubber plug used to separate the cement slurry from other fluids, reducing contamination and maintaining predictable slurry performance. Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom plug is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom plug through an increase in pump pressure.\n\nSynonyms:\ncementing plug",
  "wiper trip": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn abbreviated recovery and replacement of the drillstring in the wellbore that usually includes the bit and bottomhole assembly passing by all of the openhole, or at least all of the openhole that is thought to be potentially troublesome.

Wiper trips are commonly used when a particular zone is troublesome or if hole-cleaning efficiency is questionable.",
  "wire clamp": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA safety device attached to the slickline at surface between the hay pulley and stuffing-box pulley. The wire clamp generally is applied when the slickline is to be stationary for a period of time. This prevents the tool string from dropping down the wellbore if the winch unit fails or the slickline becomes damaged at surface.",
  "wire-wrapped screen": "1. n. [Well Completions]\n\nA type of screen used in sand control applications to support the gravel pack. To form the screen, a profiled wire is wrapped and welded in place on a perforated liner. Screens are available in a range of sizes and specifications, including outside diameter, material type and the geometry and dimension of the screen slots. The space between each wire wrap must be small enough to retain the gravel placed behind the screen, yet minimize any restriction to production.\n\nSynonyms:\nscreen",
  "wireline": "1. adj. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nRelated to any aspect of logging that employs an electrical cable to lower tools into the borehole and to transmit data. Wireline logging is distinct from measurements-while-drilling (MWD) and mud logging.\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA general term used to describe well-intervention operations conducted using single-strand or multistrand wire or cable for intervention in oil or gas wells. Although applied inconsistently, the term commonly is used in association with electric logging and cables incorporating electrical conductors. Similarly, the term slickline is commonly used to differentiate operations performed with single-strand wire or braided lines.",
  "wireline cutter": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA downhole tool used to cut slickline from a tool string that is stuck or jammed in a wellbore. The wireline cutter is attached to the slickline at surface and dropped down the wellbore. When the cutting tool impacts the tool string, a cutting mechanism cuts the slickline and enables recovery of the line in preparation for further fishing operations.",
  "wireline formation test": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nTest taken with a wireline formation tester. The wireline formation pressure measurement is acquired by inserting a probe into the borehole wall and performing a minidrawdown and buildup by withdrawing a small amount of formation fluid and then waiting for the pressure to build up to the formation pore pressure. This measurement can provide formation pressures along the borehole, thereby giving a measure of pressure with depth or along a horizontal borehole. The trend in formation pressure with depth provides a measure of the formation-fluid density, and a change in this trend may indicate a fluid contact. Abrupt changes in formation pressure measurements with depth indicate differential pressure depletion and demonstrate barriers to vertical flow. Lateral variation in formation pressure measurements along a horizontal well or in multiple vertical wells indicate reservoir heterogeneity.\n\nSee:\nfluid contact, formation fluid, formation pressure",
  "wireline formation tester": "1. n. [Well Testing]\n\nA tool run on an electric logging cable that pushes a probe into the formation, which then allows production into a small closed chamber. The tool is primarily used to obtain formation pressures at chosen locations in an interval, and, with an accurate quartz gauge, permeability estimates may be obtained. Modern variations on this tool have been developed to acquire formation-fluid samples.\n\nSynonyms:\nfluid tester\n\nSee:\nformation pressure, wireline",
  "wireline grab": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA fishing tool used for the retrieval of broken or cut slickline from the wellbore. Wireline grabs are intended to catch and engage wireline that has been bunched or nested in the wellbore. For that reason, they are often run after a blind box or similar fullbore tool has been used to nest the wireline.",
  "wireline log": "1. n. [Reservoir Characterization, Formation Evaluation, Drilling]\n\nA continuous measurement of formation properties with electrically powered instruments to infer properties and make decisions about drilling and production operations. The record of the measurements, typically a long strip of paper, is also called a log. Measurements include\n\nelectrical properties (resistivity and conductivity at various frequencies)\nsonic properties\nactive and passive nuclear measurements\ndimensional measurements of the wellbore\nformation fluid sampling\nformation pressure measurement\nwireline-conveyed sidewall coring tools.\n\nFor wireline measurements, the logging tool (or sonde) is lowered into the open wellbore on a multiple conductor, contra-helically armored wireline cable. Once the tool string has reached the bottom of the interval of interest, measurements are taken on the way out of the wellbore. This is done in an attempt to maintain tension on the cable (which stretches) as constant as possible for depth correlation purposes. (The exception to this practice is in certain hostile environments in which the tool electronics might not survive the downhole temperatures for long enough to allow the tool to be lowered to the bottom of the hole and measurements to be recorded while pulling the tool up the hole. In this case, \"down log\" measurements might be conducted on the way into the well and repeated on the way out if possible.)\nMost wireline measurements are recorded continuously while the sonde is moving. Certain fluid sampling and pressure-measuring tools require that the sonde be stopped, increasing the chance that the sonde or the cable might become stuck. Logging while drilling (LWD) tools take measurements in much the same way as wireline-logging tools, except that the measurements are taken by a self-contained tool near the bottom of the bottomhole assembly and are recorded downward (as the well is deepened) rather than upward from the bottom of the hole.\n\nSee:\nhostile environment, log",
  "wireline-retrievable safety valve (WRSV)": "1. n. [Well Completions]\n\nA type of safety valve in which the principal components can be run and retrieved by wireline or slickline. The valve assembly is landed in a ported nipple that is equipped with a control line connected to the surface control system.

[Drilling]\n\nThe repair or stimulation of an existing production well for the purpose of restoring, prolonging or enhancing the production of hydrocarbons.\n\nSee:\nhydrocarbon\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nThe process of performing major maintenance or remedial treatments on an oil or gas well. In many cases, workover implies the removal and replacement of the production tubing string after the well has been killed and a workover rig has been placed on location. Through-tubing workover operations, using coiled tubing, snubbing or slickline equipment, are routinely conducted to complete treatments or well service activities that avoid a full workover where the tubing is removed. This operation saves considerable time and expense.\n\nSee:\ngas well, kill, oil well, production string, production tubing",
  "workover fluid": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA well-control fluid, typically a brine, that is used during workover operations.

  "worm": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA new, completely inexperienced member of the drilling crew. Such a crewmember is stereotyped as prone to making mistakes and being injured, and typically endures pranks played on him by the drilling crew. While the terms weevil and its close cousin, worm, are used widely, they are labels of inexperience, rather than derogatory terms.\n\nSynonyms:\nweevil",
  "wormhole": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nA large, empty channel that can penetrate several feet into the formation, caused by the nonuniform dissolution of limestone or dolomite by hydrochloric acid [HCl].\n\nWormholes are created during matrix stimulation or acid fracturing of carbonate formations. The purpose of matrix stimulation is to create highly conductive wormholes to bypass damage. However, in fracture acidizing, wormholing is a problem, since it is an unwanted diversion of the live acid from the hydraulic fracture system, which causes a reduction of the etched fracture length.\n\nSee:\nhydraulic fracturing\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Heavy Oil]\n\nA high-porosity, high-permeability channel that develops when heavy oil is produced simultaneously with sand (during cold heavy oil production with sand, or CHOPS). Wormholes develop in a radial pattern away from the borehole and can extend 150 m [492 ft] from the borehole. The development of wormholes can cause reservoir pressure to fall below the bubblepoint, resulting in dissolved gas coming out of solution and forming foamy oil.",
  "wrench fault": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nA type of strike-slip fault in which the fault surface is vertical, and the fault blocks move sideways past each other. Given the geological complexity of some deformed rocks, including rocks that have experienced more than one episode of deformation, it can be difficult to distinguish a wrench fault from a strike-slip fault. Also, areas can be deformed more than once or experience ongoing structuring such that fault surfaces can be rotated from their original orientations.\n\nSee:\nfault",
  "zip collars": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nDrill collars (usually straight drill collars) that have been machined with a reduced diameter at the box (up) end so that they may be more easily handled with open-and-close elevators. The elevators close around the reduced-diameter section, latch securely, and a shoulder on the elevators prevents the larger diameter end of the collar from passing through the elevators, so the collars can be lifted. If zip grooves are not used on the collars, special lifting subs must be threaded into each stand of collars for lifting, which is time-consuming and less efficient than zip grooves. The primary drawback to zip grooves is that they may reduce the life of the collar by putting an effective limit on how many times the collar threads may be recut.\n\nSee:\ndrill collar, elevator, lifting sub",

  "abnormal pressure": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nA subsurface condition in which the pore pressure of a geologic formation exceeds or is less than the expected, or normal, formation pressure. When impermeable rocks such as shales are compacted rapidly, their pore fluids cannot always escape and must then support the total overlying rock column, leading to abnormally high formation pressures. Excess pressure, called overpressure or geopressure, can cause a well to blow out or become uncontrollable during drilling. Severe underpressure can cause the drillpipe to stick to the underpressured formation.\n\nSee:\ncompaction, geopressure gradient, geostatic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, normal pressure, pressure gradient\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Drilling]\n\nReservoir pore fluid pressure that is not similar to normal saltwater gradient pressure.

The test measures weight loss of a specially shaped, stainless steel mixer blade after 20 min at 11, 000 rpm running in a laboratory-prepared mud sample. Abrasiveness is quantified by the rate of weight loss, reported in units of mg/min.\nMineral hardness, particle size, and shape are the main parameters that affect abrasiveness of weighting materials. Some crystalline forms of hematite grind to a higher percentage of large particles than do other forms and are therefore more abrasive. Hematites are harder than barites, grind courser, and are more abrasive. Thus, a hematite that is proposed as a weighting material for mud is typically a candidate for abrasion testing.\n\nSee:\nbarite, ilmenite, iron oxide, particle-size distribution, sand test",
  "abrasive jetting": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA wellbore treatment in which a fluid laden with solid particles is used to remove deposits from the surface of wellbore tubulars and completion components. The treatment fluid is pumped at high pressure through a downhole tool equipped with nozzles that direct a jet or jets of fluid onto the target area.\nMost tool designs use a controlled rotary motion to ensure complete circumferential treatment of internal surfaces. Abrasive jetting techniques can also be used to cut completion or wellbore components. For this application, highly abrasive particles, such as sand, are carried in a fluid and jetted at the target area over an extended period to erode the tubular.",
  "absolute age": "1. n. [Geology]\n\nThe measurement of age in years. The determination of the absolute age of rocks, minerals, and fossils, in years before the present, is the basis for the field of geochronology. The measurement of the decay of radioactive isotopes, especially uranium, strontium, rubidium, argon, and carbon, has allowed geologists to more precisely determine the age of rock formations. Tree rings and seasonal sedimentary deposits called varves can be counted to determine absolute age.\nAlthough the term implies otherwise, \"absolute\" ages typically have some amount of potential error and are inexact.

  "damage": "1. n. [Enhanced Oil Recovery]\n\nNatural or induced production impairments that can develop in the reservoir, the near-wellbore area, the perforations, the gravel-pack completion or the production pipelines, such as the tubing. Natural damage occurs as produced reservoir fluids move through the reservoir, while induced damage is the result of external operations and fluids in the well, such as drilling, well completion, workover operations or stimulation treatments. Some induced damage triggers natural damage mechanisms.\n\nNatural damage includes phenomena such as fines migration, clay swelling, scale formation, organic deposition, including paraffins or asphaltenes, and mixed organic and inorganic deposition. Induced damage includes plugging caused by foreign particles in the injected fluid, wettability changes, emulsions, precipitates or sludges caused by acid reactions, bacterial activity and water blocks.\n\nWellbore cleanup or matrix stimulation treatments are two different operations that can remove natural or induced damage.

Near-wellbore damage can significantly affect productivity and is typically easier to prevent than it is to cure. Although almost always present, a lightly damaged zone around the wellbore can be bypassed by perforation tunnels to create connecting conduits from the wellbore to the undamaged reservoir formation. More severe cases of damage may require a matrix-acidizing treatment to restore the natural permeability, or a hydraulic fracturing treatment to create a new high-conductivity flow path to the reservoir.\n\nSee:\nhydraulic fracturing, matrix acidizing",
  "damping": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nThe opposition, slowing or prevention of oscillation, or decreasing vibration amplitude, as kinetic energy dissipates.

In most instruments, a 137Cs (cesium) or 241Am (americium) source is used to induce Compton scattering, as in the openhole density measurement, except that the device is unfocused. The count rate at the detector then depends primarily on the density of the fluids in the well. In some devices, the fluids pass through an open space in the body of the tool within which the measurement is made. The results then reflect the density of the fluids passing through the tool. In other devices, the source and detector are isolated so that the gamma rays pass outside the tool. The results then reflect some average density of all the fluids within the well. In smaller casings, some formation signal may contaminate the measurement.\n\nCompared with a gradiomanometer, the nuclear fluid densimeter is a less direct measurement of density, and has a statistical uncertainty and less resolution.

  "H2S": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\n[H2S]\n\nAn extraordinarily poisonous gas with a molecular formula of H2S. At low concentrations, H2S has the odor of rotten eggs, but at higher, lethal concentrations, it is odorless. H2S is hazardous to workers and a few seconds of exposure at relatively low concentrations can be lethal, but exposure to lower concentrations can also be harmful. The effect of H2S depends on duration, frequency and intensity of exposure as well as the susceptibility of the individual.\nHydrogen sulfide is a serious and potentially lethal hazard, so awareness, detection and monitoring of H2S is essential. Since hydrogen sulfide gas is present in some subsurface formations, drilling and other operational crews must be prepared to use detection equipment, personal protective equipment, proper training and contingency procedures in H2S-prone areas.\nHydrogen sulfide is produced during the decomposition of organic matter and occurs with hydrocarbons in some areas. It enters drilling mud from subsurface formations and can also be generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in stored muds. H2S can cause sulfide-stress-corrosion cracking of metals. Because it is corrosive, H2S production may require costly special production equipment such as stainless steel tubing.\nSulfides can be precipitated harmlessly from water muds or oil muds by treatments with the proper sulfide scavenger. H2S is a weak acid, donating two hydrogen ions in neutralization reactions, forming HS- and S-2 ions. In water or water-base muds, the three sulfide species, H2S and HS- and S-2 ions, are in dynamic equilibrium with water and H+ and OH- ions. The percent distribution among the three sulfide species depends on pH. H2S is dominant at low pH, the HS- ion is dominant at mid-range pH and S2 ions dominate at high pH. In this equilibrium situation, sulfide ions revert to H2S if pH falls. Sulfides in water mud and oil mud can be quantitatively measured with the Garrett Gas Train according to procedures set by API.\n\nAlternate Form:\nhydrogen sulfide",

Hard alloy overlays are applied to the points of greatest contact, typically using advanced welding techniques. Typical alloys used in this process range from ultra-wear resistant tungsten carbide, to less abrasive chromium carbide, titanium carbide and borides.

  "J factor": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nAnother term for pseudogeometrical factor, the response of a logging measurement as a function of distance from the tool. The pseudogeometrical factor is normally radial, reflecting the response perpendicular to the tool. It can be a differential factor, which is the contribution to the signal at a particular distance, but is more normally integrated, which is the sum of all signals from the tool to a particular distance.\n\nThe pseudogeometrical factor developed from the concept of the geometrical factor, and is expressed in the same way. For example, for a radial distance x from the tool, the integrated radial pseudogeometrical factor, Jx, can be written as:\n\nJx = (Ux - Ut) / (Uxo - Ut)\n\nwhere Ut is the log reading of the undisturbed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with no invasion), Uxo is the log reading of the flushed zone (or, alternatively, the reading with infinite invasion), and Ux is the log reading with a step profile invasion to depth x. Unlike the geometrical factor, Jx depends on the values of both Uxo and Ut. Pseudogeometrical factors are a useful way to express the radial response (or vertical response) in typical conditions. The physics of each measurement determines how much Jx varies with Uxo and Ut.\n\nPseudogeometrical factors are often used to express the response of nuclear and resistivity logs, but are not appropriate for acoustic and electromagnetic propagation logs (where the response is too dependent on the contrast in properties), or nuclear magnetic resonance logs (where the response is too localized).\n\nSee:\npseudogeometrical factor",

  "jar": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nA mechanical device used downhole to deliver an impact load to another downhole component, especially when that component is stuck. There are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. The principle is similar to that of a carpenter using a hammer. Kinetic energy is stored in the hammer as it is swung, and suddenly released to the nail and board when the hammer strikes the nail. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder, imparting an impact load. In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling.\n\nSee:\nbottomhole assembly, fishing tool\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

Simple slickline jars incorporate an assembly that allows some free travel within the tool to gain momentum for the impact that occurs at the end of the stroke. Larger, more complex jars for coiled tubing or workover strings incorporate a trip or firing mechanism that prevents the jar from operating until the desired tension is applied to the string, thus optimizing the impact delivered. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well.",

High pH was needed to neutralize tannic acids to form the tannates, which are red. The oilfield name red mud was applied to tannate-dispersed muds.A legend of the oil patch holds that, back in the days when quebracho mud was all the rage (in the days when Hobby Airport was Houston's main airport), a mud man parked his old field car in the airport parking lot for several days. It was raining when he left, but sunny when he got back. The police were waiting to talk to him when he returned because someone noticed a dried blood-red stain under his car. The liquid had obviously leaked out of the trunk. When the mud man opened the trunk for the police, they found two wet sacks of quebracho. As you may have guessed, his trunk lid leaked.\n\nSee:\nclay, deflocculant, deflocculated mud, lignin, lignosulfonate, pH, starch, tannic acid, tannin",

The rig crew racks back pipe after the stand is unscrewed from the rest of the drillstring. The floor crew then pushes the lower part of the stand away from the rotary table to a position on one side of the vee-door. While the floor crew is pushing the pipe, the derrickman gets ready to pull the top of the stand over into the fingerboards. Once the rig crew has the pipe in the correct location, the driller slacks off on the drawworks, allowing the stand to rest on the drillfloor. This takes weight off of the elevators previously supporting the pipe at the top, so the derrickman can then unlatch the elevators and pull the top of the pipe into the fingerboards for storage. Modern rig designs have automated pipe-handling equipment that moves the pipe.

  "walk-above vertical seismic profile (VSP)": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nA type of vertical seismic profile to accommodate the geometry of a deviated well; sometimes called a vertical incidence VSP. Each receiver is in a different lateral position with the source directly above the receiver for all cases. Such data provide a high-resolution seismic image of the subsurface below the trajectory of the well.\n\nSee:\ndeviated hole, vertical seismic profile",
  "walkaway vertical seismic profile (VSP)": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nA type of vertical seismic profile in which the source is moved to progressively farther offset at the surface and receivers are held in a fixed location, effectively providing a mini 2D seismic line that can be of higher resolution than surface seismic data and provides more continuous coverage than an offset VSP. 3D walkaways, using a surface grid of source positions, provide 3D images in areas where the surface seismic data do not provide an adequate image due to near-surface effects or surface obstructions. Walkaway VSPs in which the receivers are placed just above the reservoir are gaining acceptance as a tool to quantify seismic attributes and calibrate surface seismic data.\n\nSee:\noffset, receiver, source, vertical seismic profile",
  "wall cake": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids, Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe residue deposited on a permeable medium when a slurry, such as a drilling fluid, is forced against the medium under a pressure. Filtrate is the liquid that passes through the medium, leaving the cake on the medium. Drilling muds are tested to determine filtration rate and filter-cake properties. Cake properties such as cake thickness, toughness, slickness and permeability are important because the cake that forms on permeable zones in the wellbore can cause stuck pipe and other drilling problems. Reduced oil and gas production can result from reservoir damage when a poor filter cake allows deep filtrate invasion. A certain degree of cake buildup is desirable to isolate formations from drilling fluids. In openhole completions in high-angle or horizontal holes, the formation of an external filter cake is preferable to a cake that forms partly inside the formation. The latter has a higher potential for formation damage.\n\nSynonyms:\nmudcake\n\nSee:\ndeflocculated mud, drilling fluid, dynamic filtration, filter-cake quality, filter-cake thickness, filtrate volume, openhole completion, relative filtrate volume, resin, static filtration",
  "wall loss": "1. n. [Production Logging]\n\nThe loss of material on the inside or outside of a casing or tubing due to corrosion. Monitoring wall loss in situ helps determine when the pipe may be at risk for leaking or failure. Wall loss is determined by comparing casing or tubing thickness measured by electromagnetic, acoustic resonance or mechanical methods with either an earlier measurement or an assumed value.\n\nSynonyms:\nmetal loss\n\nAntonyms:\nmetal gain\n\nSee:\ncasing-inspection log, electromagnetic thickness",
  "wall sticking": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAlso known as differential sticking, a condition whereby the drillstring cannot be moved (rotated or reciprocated) along the axis of the wellbore. Differential sticking typically occurs when high-contact forces caused by low reservoir pressures, high wellbore pressures, or both, are exerted over a sufficiently large area of the drillstring. Differential sticking is, for most drilling organizations, the greatest drilling problem worldwide in terms of time and financial cost. It is important to note that the sticking force is a product of the differential pressure between the wellbore and the reservoir and the area that the differential pressure is acting upon. This means that a relatively low differential pressure (delta p) applied over a large working area can be just as effective in sticking the pipe as can a high differential pressure applied over a small area.\n\nSynonyms:\ndifferential sticking\n\nSee:\nlow-colloid oil mud, mechanical sticking, overbalance, pill, reservoir pressure, saltwater flow, stuck pipe\n\n\n\n\n2. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA situation in which the drilling assembly (pipe, drill collars and bottomhole assembly) is stuck in filter cake that was previously deposited on a permeable zone. The pipe is held in the cake by a difference in pressures between the hydrostatic pressure of the mud and the pore pressure in the permeable zone. The force required to pull the pipe free can exceed the strength of the pipe. Methods used to get the pipe free, in addition to pulling and torquing the pipe, include: (1) lowering hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore, (2) placing a spotting fluid next to the stuck zone and (3) applying shock force just above the stuck point by mechanical jarring, or (4) all the above. The most common approach, however, to getting free is to place a spot of oil, oil-base mud, or special spotting fluid.\n\nSynonyms:\ndifferential sticking\n\nSee:\nfiltercake, spotting fluid",
  "Walsh-Hadamard transform": "1. n. [Geophysics]\n\nIn digital signal processing, a nonsinusoidal transform by addition and subtraction. The Walsh-Hadamard transform is similar to Fourier series analysis, but uses square waves instead of sinusoidal waves. It is used predominantly in communication theory and, to a lesser extent, in filtering logs with a blocky character.\n\nSee:\nfilter, Fourier analysis, Fourier transform",
  "Walther's law": "1. n. [Reservoir Characterization]\n\nA law stating that lithologies that conformably overlie one another must have accumulated in adjacent depositional environments. Exceptions occur where there are erosional breaks. This law allows for transformations from the vertical data to a horizontal set and is often used when a vertical sequence of facies has been identified and characterized (for example, with Markov chain analysis) to estimate the horizontal depositional pattern.",
  "wash pipe": "1. n. [Well Workover and Intervention]\n\nA tool-string component used with a burn shoe for washover operations. The wash pipe is a relatively large internal-diameter tubular that can be washed over a fish in preparation for engaging and retrieving the fish.\n\nSee:\nburn shoe, tool string",
  "washout": "1. n. [Drilling]\n\nAn enlarged region of a wellbore. A washout in an openhole section is larger than the original hole size or size of the drill bit. Washout enlargement can be caused by excessive bit jet velocity, soft or unconsolidated formations, in-situ rock stresses, mechanical damage by BHA components, chemical attack and swelling or weakening of shale as it contacts fresh water. Generally speaking, washouts become more severe with time. Appropriate mud types, mud additives and increased mud density can minimize washouts.\n\nSee:\ndrill bit, float shoe, guide shoe, jet velocity\n\n\n\n\n2. n.

  "X-ray diffraction": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA technique for the semiquantitative mineralogical analysis of a sample of rock by measuring the diffraction peaks in X-rays diffracted by the sample. The position of the diffraction peaks is a measure of the distance between discrete crystallographic diffracting planes within minerals, while their intensity indicates the quantity of the mineral. The technique is only semiquantitative because the size and shape of the diffraction peak are strongly influenced by the geometry of the measurement, for example orientation of the minerals, and sample preparation. Fine particles such as clays must be separated from larger particles and measured separately if they are to be detected properly. To reduce errors associated with preferred orientation of minerals, samples are most commonly ground to a powder before analysis, a technique known as powder X-ray diffraction.\n\nSee:\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy",
  "X-ray fluorescence (XRF)": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nA technique for elemental analysis of samples based on the characteristic fluorescence given off by different elements subjected to X-rays. In core analysis, X-ray fluorescence often is used to help determine mineral content. The elemental volumes are inverted to mineral volumes by assuming certain standard formulae for mineral composition.\n\nSee:\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy",
  "X-signal": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe reactive (X) signal, or that part of the alternating signal at the receiver of an induction logging tool that is out of phase with the transmitter current. This signal, also known as the quadrature signal, is less sensitive to formation conductivity and must be separated from the R-signal, which is the main or, in older tools, the only source of the induction log. In a simple two-coil array, a large component of the X-signal is caused by direct coupling between transmitter and receiver coils. This direct signal is largely eliminated by use of a bucking coil. The X-signal provides a first-order correction to the skin effect of the R-signal.\n\nSee:\n6FF40, array induction",
  "xanthan gum": "1. n. [Drilling Fluids]\n\nA polysaccharide secreted by the bacteria genus Xanthomonas campestris, also known as XC polymer. XC in water muds provides non-Newtonian mud rheology, highly desirable because of the flat velocity profile it produces in annular flow, which is required for efficient cuttings lifting in lower density muds. XC polymer is anionic, with tolerance for salinity and fair tolerance for hardness ions. XC is a finely powdered material that can vary in the amount of residual bacteria debris and the ease with which it disperses into water. Temperature tolerance varies with water-phase components but starts to degrade around 200 to 250 degF [93 to 121 degC].

Xylene is an excellent solvent, especially for aromatic solids such as asphaltic materials. It is used as a solvent and emulsion breaker in workover operations to clean up reservoirs. In drilling mud testing, a 50/50 xylene/isopropanol (IPA) mixture had been used to break oil-mud emulsions prior to titrations to measure alkalinity, chloride and calcium. However, the xylene mixture has been replaced by a single material, propylene glycol normal propyl ether (PNP), to break oil mud emulsions.\n\nSee:\noil-emulsion mud",

[Drilling Fluids]\n\nA term used to specify the quality of a clay according to the number of barrels of 30-cP viscosity mud that one ton of the clay would produce. Although seldom used today, clays were classified as high-, medium- or low-yield bentonites. A \"good\" bentonite produced at least 85 bbl of mud per ton. High-yield clays produced 30 to 50 bbl/tonUS, and low-yield clays produced 15 to 30 bbl/tonUS. (Note that yield and yield point are not related terms.)\n\nSee:\nlow-yield clay, poise, viscosity",

[Drilling Fluids]\n\nA parameter of the Bingham plastic model. YP is the yield stress extrapolated to a shear rate of zero. (Plastic viscosity, PV, is the other parameter of the Bingham-plastic model.) A Bingham plastic fluid plots as a straight line on a shear rate (x-axis) versus shear stress (y-axis) plot, in which YP is the zero-shear-rate intercept. (PV is the slope of the line.) YP is calculated from 300- and 600-rpm viscometer dial readings by subtracting PV from the 300-rpm dial reading. YP is used to evaluate the ability of a mud to lift cuttings out of the annulus. A high YP implies a non-Newtonian fluid, one that carries cuttings better than a fluid of similar density but lower YP. YP is lowered by adding deflocculant to a clay-based mud and increased by adding freshly dispersed clay or a flocculant, such as lime.\n\nAlternate Form:\nyield point\n\nSee:\naggregation, apparent viscosity, clay-water interaction, deflocculated mud, direct-indicating viscometer, drill solids, gelled-up mud, mixed-metal hydroxide",

  "Z/A effect": "1. n. [Formation Evaluation]\n\nThe ratio of the electron density to the bulk density. The electron density is equal to the bulk density multiplied by 2Z/A where Z is the average atomic number and A is the average atomic weight of the formation. The density log actually responds to electron density, whereas the desired measurement is the bulk density. Although for most rocks 2Z/A is close to 1, it is not practical to adjust 2Z/A for each formation. Instead the electron density is scaled to give the correct bulk density in limestone filled with fresh water. Then it is found that in the majority of sedimentary rocks, the log reads the bulk density within 1%. The main exceptions are halite, sylvite and low-pressure gas, because the 2Z/A of chlorine and hydrogen are not close to 1.\n\nSee:\ndensity measurement, photoelectric effect",
