But now the room is dominated by a giant wooden sculpture of an African man’s head, sculptured by an artist born in DRC. </p><p>The museum also features a new entry pavilion. </p><p>Many Belgians remain ignorant of their country’s harsh rule in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in the late 19th century. It became the setting for Joseph Conrad’s influential 1899 novella “Heart of Darkness”. </p><p>Belgium’s colonial past made the small European country one of the world’s most successful trading economies. </p><p>The 66 million euros ($75.1 million) renovation to the Africa museum, set in a palatial, neoclassical building in a landscaped park just outside the capital Brussels, hopes to confront Belgians with their colonial past. </p><p>But activists says that by containing stolen artefacts it represents a continuation of colonialism. </p><p>“There is no decolonization without restitution,” said Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, who was born in the DRC before moving to Belgium, where she authored a book on racism.  </p><p>The debate about whether colonial-era art should be returned home has intensified after French President Emmanuel Macron promised to return some African art to the continent and Germany this year published guidelines for considering repatriation. </p><p>Gryseels said the museum was open to returning some artefacts. </p><p>King Philippe declined an invitation to attend the museum’s inauguration on Saturday, but Prime Minister Charles Michel and some ministers will attend.  </p><div class="Slideshow_container Slideshow_small Slideshow_standard"><p class="Slideshow_preview-container"><figure><div class="LazyImage_container LazyImage_dark"><img src="//s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20181208&amp;t=2&amp;i=1332911576&amp;r=LYNXMPEEB700L"/></div></figure><figcaption class="Slideshow_caption">Slideshow<span class="Slideshow_count"> (18 Images)</span></figcaption><span class="Slideshow_line"/></p></div><p>Activists will hold a separate ceremony nearby at the graves of seven Congolese who died of influenza when they were imported for exhibition in a human zoo.
